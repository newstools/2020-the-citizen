The Automobile Association says fuel prices are set to increase in August despite the strengthening rand.
The association was commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund.
“As matters currently stand, petrol is likely to increase by between nine and 16 cents a litre, diesel by up to 48 cents, and illuminating paraffin by 43 cents,” it said.
