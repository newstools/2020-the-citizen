Immobile targets record
Ciro Immobile needs just one more goal to equal the scoring record for a single campaign as Lazio make the short journey to Napoli for their final game.
The 30-year-old forward already has 35 goals and can match Gonzalo Higuainâ€™s record of 36 goals, made playing for Napoli in the 2015-16 season.
