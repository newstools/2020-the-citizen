With much of the USA entranced by the build-up to this weekend’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, it’s not surprising that gridiron has been in the news prominently.
In keeping with the hype, a video has gone viral of a dog named Ernie spectacularly running 76m to catch a Frisbee.
The stadium announcer at the AAF game featuring the Orlando Apollos claimed the skillful canine’s feat was a world record, but that has subsequently been debunked.
Nonetheless, you can’t argue about the skill shown!




Following Ernie’s showstopping, the true world record was tracked down to a greyhound named Eurie, who caught a Frisbee throw of 112m!
