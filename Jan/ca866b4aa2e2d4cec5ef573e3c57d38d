Community members, volunteers and councillors will brave the rain and cold to kick off Johannesburg mayor Geoff Makhubo’s Kleena Joburg campaign on Saturday.
Makhubo, along with Environment and Infrastructure Services MMC Mpho Moerane, will be in Alexandra township on Saturday morning to launch the first leg of the clean-up campaign.
