With its move to crossovers and SUVs already progressing, the apparent replacement for the Ford Mondeo and Fusion has seemingly been named according to a new trademark application filed in Europe.
According to FordAuthority, the Blue Oval has submitted an application for the moniker Stromtrak after last year filing a request for the name Mondeo Evos in Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. It is however likely that the name could also be used for an entirely different model and applied for before being snapped up by another manufacture.
As well as the name, the online forum has also spotted an apparent test mule in the United States masquerading as a Focus Active estate and featuring a raised ride height, black exterior completely devoid of any badging, intendment in the rear bumper, covered lower air intakes and black tape around the front wheel arches.
According to the initial report by Automotive News in 2018, the crossover will rival the Subaru Outback and ride on the Focus’ C2 platform with four-wheel-drive set to be offered on some models. Being aimed at Europe, engine choices could include the 1.5 EcoBoost petrol and the 2.0 EcoBlue turbodiesel in various states of tune.
With the Fusion set to be discontinued next year and the Mondeo following suite along with the S-Max and venerable Galaxy people-carriers, chances are that the ‘Stormtrak’ could debut as early as 2021 on the Old Continent.
