The 2020 South African circuit racing season will commence on a spectacular and international note at the Zwartkops Raceway near Pretoria this weekend. The Passion for Speed racing extravaganza will offer spectators a wide variety of motorsport highlights from the past and the present on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Topping Saturday’s bill in terms of sheer spectacle should be two races for SKF Pre-1966 Legend Saloon Cars. Dubbed the event’s Races of Champions, the two eight-lap heats will feature drivers like maestro Sarel van der Merwe (Ford Galaxie), Hennie Groenewald (Mercury Comet), Jeffrey Kruger (Plymouth Barracuda), Lee Thompson (Ford Galaxie), Colin Ellison (Ford Fairlane), Peter Lindenberg (Shelby Ford Mustang), Jonathan du Toit (Chevrolet Nova), Mark du Toit (Ford Thunderbolt), and visitor from the Netherlands Michel Campagne (Ford Fairlane).
The Under Two-litre category should see front-runners like Vic Campher (Tom Campher Volvo 122S), Carel Pienaar (Lotus Cortina), Rob Gearing (BMW 2002), Roger Houston (Alfa Romeo Guilia), Alan Poulter (Vic Campher Volvo 122S), Robyn Kriel (BMW 300), Francesco Lombardi (Alfa Romeo Guilia), Wouter Roos (Alfa Romeo GT) and Patrick Gearing (Alfa Romeo Guilia).
The event’s international flavour will mainly centre around two 10-lap races for Pre-1966 Historic Grand Prix Association cars, with 19 venerable Formula One entries taking to the tarmac. Frontrunners should include the 1964 Brabham BT11 of John Romano, the 1961 Lotus 18 of Andrew Beaumont, the 1962 Lotus 18/21 of Eric Staes, the 1964 Cooper Ford of Chris Drake, the 1960 Lotus 18 Alfa of Brad Hoyt, the 1960 Heron Alfa of Eddy Perk and the 1960 Cooper T53 of Will Nuthall. The absolute star of the show should be the extremely rare 1956 Maserati F250 of Christian Dumolin – easily the most expensive car at the event.
The fastest historic cars of the weekend should be the Pre-1974 International Sports Racing Prototypes. Podium contenders should include Larry Wilford (Genie Lola T70), Colin Ellison (Chevron B19), Andre’ Bezuidenhout (Porsche RSR Turbo), Jonathan du Toit (Chevron B8), Peter Bailey (Porsche 917), Keegan Campos (Porsche 911 RSR), Mark du Toit (Lola T70 Spyder), Neil Lobb (Lola T70), plus Swedish visitors Janne Kling  (Ford GT40), Brent Andersson (Lola 212) and Kenneth Persson (Ford GT40).
