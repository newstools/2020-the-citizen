Unveiled towards the end of last year, Hyundai has revealed price and spec details in India of its new Grand i10 Nios-based Aura sedan.
Replacing high-end versions of the previous Grand i10 derived Xcent, the Aura sports dimensions of 3 995 mm in overall length with a wheelbase of 2 450 mm, height of 1 520 mm and width of 1 680 mm while offering a total boot capacity of 402-litres. Aimed at the likes of the Maruti Suzuki DZire, Ford Aspire, known locally as the Figo Sedan, the Honda Amaze and the India only Tata Tigor, the Aura will be offered in a choice of five trim levels and powered by three engines across a 12 model line-up.
Starting the range off, the E boasts front electric windows, a cooled glovebox, dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, rear parking sensors and colour coded bumpers, while the next step-up S receives auto lock/unlock doors, keyless entry, rear air-conditioning vents, colour coded electric mirrors with a folding mechanism on automatic models, projector-type headlights with follow-me-home function, rear electric windows and a two-speaker Bluetooth enabled sound system.

As well as a tilt-adjustable steering wheel, the S’ wheel sizes also differ with manual transmission models receiving 14-inch steel wheels and automatic derivatives 15-inch steelies, both with plastic wheel covers. A satin bronze honeycomb pattern dashboard and a blacked-out B-pillar round the S off.
Up next, the SX swaps the mentioned sound system for an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment display with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, voice recognition and a reverse camera, while other niceties include a Arkamys audio system, 15-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, chrome door handles, faux metal interior door handles and a 5.3-inch instrument cluster display. Reserved for the SX (O) is cruise control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a leather-wrapped gear knob.
Capping the range off is the SX+ that gains all of the features of the SX and SX (O), but adds automatic climate control, a wireless smartphone charger and for petrol models only, dark grey interior door handles, a gloss black grille and a black interior with red inserts.

Motivating the Aura is a choice of two petrol engines and one turbodiesel, the former consisting of a normally aspirated 1.2-litre four-cylinder that produces 63kW/114Nm and a detuned version of the Venue’s 1.0 T-GDI rated at 74kW/175Nm. In addition, the former comes with the option of running on compressed natural gas (CNG) that result in outputs dropping to 51kW/96Nm. Buyers opting for diesel power will receive a three-cylinder 1.2 that delivers 55kW/190Nm.
In terms of transmissions, all models are equipped as standard with a five-speed manual gearbox, although a five-speed automated manual (AMT) can be had as an option on the diesel and the free-breathing, non CNG petrol.
For now, sales of the Aura, like the Xcent, is limited to India with Hyundai South Africa still to confirm availability.
