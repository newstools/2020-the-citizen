Recent Grade 1 Cape Guineas runner-up Viva Rio returns in a mere Progress Plate over 1600m at Kenilworth tomorrow and should have no problems racking up a fourth career win over this trip.
This Glen Kotzen-trained gelding never quite looked like getting to Kilindini on that occasion but plugged away gamely to secure second. He is clearly out of the top drawer and even giving away weight all round should carry too much fire power for the sparse four rivals who have stood their ground.
This son of Oratorio is likely to go off a short-priced favourite and it would be a shock were he not to win this. Worth a decent bet and can be bankered in all exotics. The main threat, Westlife, has been scratched, leaving only four other runners in the first leg of the Pick 6.
A good value bet looks to be Window To Africa in Race 6 over 1000m. This Andre Nel-trained Trippi filly looked to be coming back to something like her best when third to subsequent easy repeat winner Sunshine Mint in Port Elizabeth a month ago.
She boasts some excellent course and distance form and has a decent chance of scoring a second career win in what looks a completive heat. A first-timer who is going to attract a lot of attention is the Bre Crawford-trained Our Prized Jewel in Race 2.
This Duke Of Marmalade filly is a half-sister to a couple of Grade 1 winners and meets a far from gifted bunch of maidens over 1200m. Significantly, owners Ridgemont’s retained jockey Anton Marcus travels to Cape Town for just the one ride, which is a sign of intent if ever there was one. She can be expected to do the business without any fuss at what are sure to be cramped odds.
