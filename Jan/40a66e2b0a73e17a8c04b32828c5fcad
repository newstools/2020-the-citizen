Protesters in Osizweni have barricaded most exit roads leading to Madadeni and town with skip bins and burning tyres on Thursday morning.
A Newcastle Advertiser journalist witnessed looting at the Five Star corner shop, owned by a Pakistani national, next to the local municipality building. The looting went on for about 20 minutes before police arrived and the crowd dispersed.

Another shop owner, Pakistani national Akash Habib, who owns a shop in Kwamakhasane, said looters gathered at his shop just after 1am.
“They came to my shop and took everything. I’m left with absolutely nothing, not even a 10 cent to my name. I called police, but by the time they arrived, it was over for my shop. They had taken everything.”
Akash Habib’s shop was looted by protesters, and he is left with nothing.
Habib was at the Osizweni police station, reporting the case.
