The cancellation of a number of products last year shortly before its parent company’s partnership with the PSA Group became official, Alfa Romeo is seemingly on the rebound with a new report claiming that the iconic GTA moniker could return as the new performance derivative of the recently facelifted Giulia.
According to moparinsiders.com, citing an unnamed source with knowledge of the project, the GTA designation, last used on the 156 that ended production 15 years ago, will slot-in above the current range-topping Giulia Quadrifoglio Verde (QV), and reportedly produce in the region of 620 horsepower or 463 kW from the same Ferrari-derived 2.9-litre twin-turbo V6 engine.
Representing an 88 kW power increase, the online site also claims that the GTA will trim some 20 kg off of the QV’s curb weight, and retain the standard issue eight-speed automatic transmission. If indeed confirmed, along with the reported power hike, expect the GTA’s performance to improve on that of the QV, which has a top speed of 307 km/h and does 0-100 km/h in 3.9 seconds.
Allegedly said to be a limited edition model, the site reports that the GTA could debut on 24 June in Alfa Romeo’s hometown of Milan to coincide with the marque’s 110th birthday.
In a related report, motorionline.com claims that the aforementioned celebration will also see the debut of not only the production Tonale compact SUV that could be previewed at the Geneva Motor Show in March, but also the concept B-segment SUV that will use PSA architecture. In spite of the mentioned axing of some models, the site reports that a new sports car could be shown at said event possibly wearing the 6C moniker.
