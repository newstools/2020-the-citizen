A woman has been shot dead and a man seriously wounded in a shooting incident at Khobongwaneni in Taylors Halt, KwaZulu-Natal paramedic services said on Thursday.
ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived at the scene around midday and found several vehicles alight.
He said the body of a woman was found lying in a field while a man was found inside their residence.
“Fire services began to extinguish the fires while medics assessed the patients. Assessments showed that the woman had sustained a gunshot wound to the head and showed no signs of life while the man had sustained a gunshot wound to his shoulder.”
