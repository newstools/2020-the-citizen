Eskom has confirmed that load shedding has been downgraded from Stage 2 to Stage 1, as some of the generating units which had not been functioning return to service.
Stage 1 load shedding will take place from 6am until 11pm on Friday.
The struggling energy utility says its pumped storage schemes have been “sufficiently replenished”, and it is working “to improve on the levels of diesel at our open cycle gas turbine generators”.
While Eskom says it will use these emergency reserves on Friday, it added that it would attempt “to use as little diesel as possible” in a bid to manage its costs.
The utility calls on South Africans to “reduce demand”.
