Fresh from respective unveilings less than two weeks ago, Porsche has now divulged pricing details of the normally aspirated 718 Cayman and Boxster GTS.
Replacing the much criticised 2.5-litre flat-four turbocharged GTS, the free-breathing flat-six displaces 4.0-litres and produces 294kW/418Nm, up 25 kW and down only two Newton Metres, directed to the rear wheels via  six-speed manual gearbox in place of the previous seven-speed PDK.
Regardless of the model, both models are fitted as standard with the Spots Chrono package, Porsche Active Suspension Management, Porsche Torque Vectoring system, 20-inch satin gloss black alloy wheels and a mechanical limited slip differential, with the sports exhaust and Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes optional. Top speed is rated at 293 km/h with the 0-100 km/h sprint taking 4.5 seconds.
Now available for ordering with delivers set to commence in May, both come standard with a three year Drive Plan and in the case of the Cayman, a sticker price of R1 164 000 with the Boxster retailing from R1 175 000. A five year Drive Plan can be specified as an option.
