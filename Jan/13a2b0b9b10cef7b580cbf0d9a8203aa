Matheba is in the other Queen B, Beyonce’s home town because she was invited to speak at #OneTeam 2020 Conference moderated by Twitter’s Head of Social Strategy and Operations, Alphonzo Terrel, alongside fellow panellists author, Shea Serrano, and actress and media personality, Jameela Jamil.
According to a press release by the social media platform, #OneTeam 2020 is about bringing together powerful voices, who are real, authentic and impactful on Twitter.
“It is such an honour to be in a room with unique and great voices who shape powerful conversations that are important and interesting. This has definitely given me a new perspective on connecting with people all around the world,” said Matheba in a statement.
She has been on a whirlwind tour over the past year, speaking extensively about her success on social media after winning numerous international awards for her online influence, including the recent E-Entertainment People’s Choice Awards for African Influencer of the Year.
