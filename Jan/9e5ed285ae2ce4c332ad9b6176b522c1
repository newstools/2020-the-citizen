Mercedes-Benz has seemingly committed to the X-Class not becoming a single generation model as evident by new spy images showing a long wheelbase model nearing production.
Rumoured as far back as July last year to be facing the axe after Automotive News Europe reported that sales in key markets such as Australia and South Africa totalled a mere 16 700 units, claims the three-pointed star has vehemently denied in subsequent interviews, the triplet of the Nissan Navara and Renault Alaskan has been spotted with a silver insertion between the cab and loadbay that will result in the overall length and wheelbase being longer than the current 5 340 mm and 3 150 mm.
Aside from the bed length, the spy shots by carscoops.com sees the X-Class being otherwise unchanged, although the online publication noted that all of the badges and the fuel filler cap were covered with patterned and black masking tape. In addition, it claims that the added length has resulted in an altered rear suspension.
The extended wheelbase seemingly comes in response to Volkswagen’s unveiling of a long wheelbase Amarok in Australia last year, and not the existing X-Class’ body being used as a test mule to hide components of a second generation.
According to the publication, the lengthened X-Class could make its official debut at the Geneva Motor Show in March, but chances are that more details and indeed final production images will emerge before then.
