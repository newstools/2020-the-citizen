Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says action will be taken against negligent school staff following the drowning last Wednesday of 13-year-old Keamohetswe Shaun Seboko in the hostel swimming pool of Laerskool Bekker in Magaliesburg, Gauteng.
The tragedy occurred on the same day that Parktown Boys’ High grade 8 pupil Enoch Mpianzi drowned in the Crocodile River during an orientation camp at the Nyati River and Bush lodge in the North West.
At a meeting with Seboko’s family, Lesufi said the expulsion of staff guilty of negligence was “non-negotiable”.
“Where it is staff-related negligence, the department will take action. If they need to be expelled or banned … we will do it. It is non-negotiable,” he told eNCA.
“We are turning our schools into mortuaries … we must stop that.”

Lesufi said he had spent “more time comforting families” than speaking to teachers since the beginning of the school year.
“This must come to an end,” he added.
The Gauteng education department released a statement conveying “sincere condolences to the family” following the second drowning incident and confirmed that children were being counselled.
Parktown Boy’s High released a statement on the drowning of Mpianzi. The school has since indicating that it did not wish to further engage on the matter as investigations into the incident are ongoing.
“The staff, learners, SGB, and the Parktonian alumni express their deepest sympathy to the Mpianzi family following this tragic loss. The school community remains in a state of shock and counselling support has been implemented. The alumni of the school have committed to support the family where possible,” the statement said.
