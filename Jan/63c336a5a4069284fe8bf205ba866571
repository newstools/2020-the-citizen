Acting communications director of the Democratic Alliance (DA), Mabine Seabe, has resigned with immediate effect.
Seabe tweeted on Tuesday morning that he resigned on his own terms.

For the record, I resigned on my own terms.
I am working on an exciting venture with some talented people to change how the private sector communicates and channels its CSI funding.
I wish my former colleagues all the very best. https://t.co/ATaXfXRQdC

“I am working on an exciting venture with some talented people to change how the private sector communicates and channels its CSI funding,” the tweet read.
He previously served as former DA leader Mmusi Maimane’s spokesperson, as media and issues specialist for the DA in the Gauteng legislature and as national director of communications.
Before joining the DA in 2013, he was a vocal activist, who served on the national committee on My Vote Counts, and on the board of Youth Lab, a policy think-tank which sought to provide platforms for young people and decision-makers to exchange ideas and develop strategies.
Attempts to contact Seabe have been unsuccessful.
