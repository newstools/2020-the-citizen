The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has confirmed that a case of Odyssean malaria has been investigated.
This after a 19-year-old pregnant woman was diagnosed, after presenting flu-like symptoms in mid-November last year. The woman has since been treated.
According to the NICD, an investigation was conducted in the Soshanguve area where the patient and her family reside on December 4 last year.
Soshanguve is home to local and international residents, some of which come from malaria areas.
The NICD’s statement explains that the woman was likely bitten by an Anopheles mosquito, which was accidentally transported from a malaria-endemic area, such as being trapped in a road vehicle.
Odyssean malaria refers to malaria that is acquired in a non-malaria area.
The NICD said it anticipated an increase in imported and Odyssean malaria cases during and after the festive season.
It encouraged healthcare practitioners to consider malaria when diagnosing patients with unexplained fevers of above 38°C, flu-like symptoms and a history of travelling to malaria areas.
