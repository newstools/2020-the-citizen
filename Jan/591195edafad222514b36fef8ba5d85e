Jaguar-Land Rover’s (JLR) has reportedly kicked-off the next stage of its so-called Project Charge recovery plan with a shift in focus towards the all-new Range Rover Sport.
With the full-size Range Rover already undergoing pre-production testing ahead of its anticipated reveal next year and not in 2022 as initially reported by Britain’s Car Magazine last year, the latest report from Autocar alleges that Range Rover’s most profitable model, slated for unveiling in the latter year, will put more emphasis on electrification while also striking to the ideal balance between luxury and dynamics.
According to the publication, the Sport will move to the same MLA platform as its iconic sibling and the all-new Jaguar XJ, but with an evolutionary design as opposed to the radical and often controversial styling cues applied to the Land Rover Discovery.
Despite JLR’s signing of an agreement  with former owner BMW last year, and with engines sourced from Munch lined-up for not only the Range Rover but also the next generation Jaguar F-Type, the Sport will be geared towards greener technology with a mix of mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid four-and-six-cylinder engines. No mention of a V8 or any diesel motors were made.
Before its introduction however, current second generation Sport, which, aside from a number of mid-life facelifts and engine revisions has been on sale since 2013, will receive an apparent final makeover with the inclusion of a new mild-hybrid straight-six petrol engine likely to either slot-in or below the 294 kW mild-hybrid HST unveiled in February last year.
