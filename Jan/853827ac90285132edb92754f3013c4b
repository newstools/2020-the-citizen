A statement released on Sunday revealed another day of dreaded load shedding.
However, Eskom says Sunday evening’s load shedding was terminated “earlier than anticipated”, due to water levels at pumped storage schemes having been replenished.
Eskom added that no load shedding is expected on Monday, unless there is “a significant shift in plant performance and an increase in unplanned breakdowns,” in which case, load shedding would be implemented at short notice.
Eskom says breakdowns are at 13 119 MW, and that technical teams will continue to monitor the situation.
Consumers are urged to use electricity sparingly, and note that some areas could take longer to be restored.
“If customers experience outages for longer periods than announced, please contact your supplier (Eskom or the municipality), as this may be a localised power outage,” the power utility explained.
