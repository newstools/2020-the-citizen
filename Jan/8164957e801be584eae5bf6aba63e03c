Renault will be expanding its range of electric vehicles next month when it takes the covers off of the production City K-ZE at the Delhi Auto Expo in India.
Sharing the stage with the Zoe and the Twizy, the concept version that bowed in China last year will become the Kwid City K-ZE in India, and feature the same styling that tricked-down to the conventional petrol powered Kwid that debuted in South Africa three months ago.
According to electricvehicleweb.in, the K-ZE will come powered by a 26.8 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that produces 33 kW and offers a range of 271 km. Plugged-in to fast charging point, Renault claims that the K-ZE will be charged from 0-80% in 50 minutes, while using a conventional charging source will result in a four hour waiting time from 0-100%.
Set to become available in India either later this year or in 2021, the Kwid City K-ZE is, at present, not expected to arrive in South Africa anytime soon.
