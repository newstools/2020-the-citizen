It drizzled, then it rained, then the midday heat and sunshine tried to sap everyone’s energy, but the women taking part in the Gun Owners South Africa (Gosa) event Girls on Fire refused to let the weather dampen their spirits on Saturday.
“Of 130 ladies, only three didn’t pitch today so it’s absolutely amazing. We had a couple of extras who took their place in any case,” said Lynette Oxley.
This year’s theme was: “We are every woman.”
“You don’t need to be strong or young, all women can actually defend themselves,” Oxley said.
Training was an essential part of owning a firearm, Oxley added.
“Historically, handguns are not the easiest to shoot, rifles are much easier.
“At least go and shoot once a month, join a club, so you know how to clear stoppages and what your capabilities are,” she said. “The situation in South Africa is changing so much, we have a lot more women joining us wanting to defend themselves.
Oxley spoke of a group of 32 women who had joined Gosa in the Western Province en masse.
“They’ve all passed their competency tests and are becoming responsible firearm owners; they are all farmers and they fear for their lives,” said Oxley.
