While it was extensively reported last year that the Ford Ranger Raptor could receive more power in response to being offered in North America, a fresh report from Australia has now alleged that an ultra-high performance derivative is being worked on with a V8 engine.
According to whichcar.com.au, the Raptor V8 has been given approval for developing by the Blue Oval’s engineering division Down Under, and while the exact changes to the T6 platform are unknown, the sanctioned upgrades will see the Raptor dropping the often lamented 157kW/500Nm 2.0-litre bi-turbodiesel engine for the Mustang GT’s normally aspirated 5.0-litre Coyote V8.
In spite of previous reports dating back two years suggesting that the Raptor will receive a detuned version of the F-150 Raptor’s 3.5-litre EcoBoost V6, the Aussie publication alleges that the bent-eight from Ford’s hallowed pony car will instead be used, but with exact outputs still to be established.
Based on the report, the Raptor V8 could bow next year as a possible last hurrah for the T6 platform that will be reworked for the next generation Ranger and Volkswagen Amarok out in said year.
