Revived six years ago after the first generation had bowed out in 2006, a new report from Japan has claimed that the next generation Honda HR-V will debut with an all-new platform later this year.
Known in its home market as the Vezel, carsensor.net reports that the HR-V will no longer be based on the same platform as the Jazz, but become the first model to make use of the simply titled Honda Architecture. In this application, it will reportedly measure 4 350 mm in overall length with a height of 1 605 mm and width of 1 785 mm.
While little else about the platform is otherwise known, what is claimed is that the Vezel will continue to be make use of a 1.5-litre petrol engine, albeit with Honda’s latest two-motor e:HEV hybrid system that debuted on the Jazz last year instead of the current one-motor DCD configuration.
Unavailable on the current model is Honda’s Sensing array of safety and driver assistance systems that will become standard on the newcomer, though current model traits such a the flip-up Magic Rear Seats and coupe-like roofline will be carried over. Based on carsensor’s claims, the Vezel could debut in December this year before likely going on sale as the HR-V in 2021.
