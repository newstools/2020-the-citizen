Eskom has said that stage 2 load shedding was terminated on Wednesday morning but the power utility “foresees a high likelihood of implementing stage 2 [load shedding] again this evening”.
This would be done “in order to replenish water resources for its pumped storage schemes and minimise the use of diesel at the open cycle gas turbines”, Eskom said in a statement on Wednesday morning.
The state-owned entity added that “the power system remains vulnerable”.
“While we were able to replenish water levels at the pumped storage schemes overnight we are currently using these emergency resources including diesel to meet demand today.
“In the event that we lose other generation units or are unable to bring back those that were out for maintenance, load shedding may be implemented earlier in the day.”
Eskom said customers would be kept updated on the status of the power system.
“Plant breakdowns (UCLF) are at 13,471 MW as at 6am this morning. Our technical teams continue to monitor the situation, carry out planned maintenance and to work at reducing unplanned outages or breakdowns in order to enable us to minimise the possibility of load shedding.”
Eskom urged customers to reduce demand by using electricity sparingly “as a concerted collective effort can help to avoid or reduce the level of load shedding”.
