Zverev sweeps past Wawrinka to make first Grand Slam semi
German young gun Alexander Zverev stormed into his first Grand Slam semifinal on Wednesday, rallying from a set down to shatter the dreams of veteran Stan Wawrinka at the Australian Open.
The seventh seed was thumped in the first set but recovered to grind down the 2014 champion 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in hot sun on Rod Laver Arena.
He will face either world number one Rafael Nadal or Austrian fifth seed Dominic Thiem in the last four, with a final beckoning against Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer.
“It feels awesome,” said Zverev who has been donating $10,000 for each win at Melbourne Park to Australian bushfire relief, and will even hand over the Aus$4.12 million ($2.78 million) winner’s cheque if he clinches the title.
“I’ve done well at other tournaments and in other matches but could never break that barrier in Grand Slams. You can’t imagine what this means to me.
“It hope it will be the first of many.”  – AFP.

Farrell picks ‘hell of a team’ for Ireland’s Six Nations opener
Ireland head coach Andy Farrell said he had selected “a hell of a team” for the Six Nations opener against Scotland this weekend after opting for Conor Murray over John Cooney at scrumhalf.
The choice between the experience of Murray and the outstanding form of Cooney was the biggest call facing Farrell for what will be his first match in charge of Ireland since succeeding Joe Schmidt.
Farrell has opted to show faith in 78-cap Munster player Murray, with the 29-year-old Cooney among the replacements, despite a series of fine displays for Ulster.
Uncapped Caelan Doris, a former Ireland Under-20s captain, has been rewarded with a start at No 8.
“You’ve got to make a decision and we’ve got a hell of a team going into Scotland,” the English former dual code international added.
Ireland: Jordan Larmour, Andrew Conway, Garry Ringrose, Bundee Aki, Jacob Stockdale; Johnny Sexton (c), Conor Murray; Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier, CJ Stander; James Ryan, Iain Henderson; Tadhg Furlong, Rob Herring, Cian Healy. Bench: Ronan Kelleher, Dave Kilcoyne, Andrew Porter, Devin Toner, Peter O’Mahony, John Cooney, Ross Byrne, Robbie Henshaw. – AFP.
