Ncube is suspected of being the driver of a red Audi TT S going southbound earlier this month, doing well over 300km/h in a 120km/h zone.
He was tracked to a funeral in Polokwane, Limpopo, by undercover investigators.
Transport Minister Mbalula had welcomed the arrest on Sunday.
The clip was reportedly filmed late at night two Tuesdays ago, with the driver filming his dashboard, so he was driving with only one hand fully on the steering wheel.
The dashboard speed seemed to peak at 308km/h, but then briefly appeared to touch 309km/h, which may make this a record for a speeding arrest.
The car’s electronic limiter had to have been bypassed to achieve such speed.
Although the dash seemed to identify the vehicle as an Audi TT S, the only way such a model could reach this speed is if it was chipped, tuned or otherwise modified.
