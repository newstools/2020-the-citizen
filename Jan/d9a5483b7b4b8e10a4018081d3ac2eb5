Set to spearhead the performance Golf 8 range when the wraps come off of the GTI at the Geneva Motor Show in March, an alleged presentation slide has leaked on social media revealing not only the suspected final outputs of Volkswagen’s iconic hot hatch, but also the flagship R, hybrid GTE, touring car derived TCR and the diesel powered GTD.
Posted by the Cochespias Instagram page soon after another account on the picture sharing platform, wilcoblok, had leaked a rear-end image of what is believed to be that of the GTI, the slide claims that the GTI will produce 180 kW, substantiating the report from Autocar earlier this week, while the TCR will keep hold of its name in spite of previous reports, and receive a power bump from the outgoing Mk 7.5’s 213 kW to 221 kW.
While the GTE’s output is unchanged at 180 kW, the GTD, of which very little has been known until now, will deliver 147 kW from its 2.0 TDI motor, an uptake of 17 kW compared to the Mk 7.5, and the same amount of twist as the Mk V GTI.
Debuting at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in July, the slide confirms the report from Britain’s Car Magazine that the R will produce 245 kW in alleged standard form with a more potent R Plus, based on the same report, likely to arrive soon after with a claimed output of 257 kW in spite of reports dating back two years that it will feature a mild-hybrid drivetrain with as much as 298 kW.
With sightings and leaks likely to become more prevalent in the coming weeks and months, expect more technical details about all four models to be divulged as well.
