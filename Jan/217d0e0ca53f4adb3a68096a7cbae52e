Kick-off is at 5pm.
Aranos Coetzee returns from injury and will be starting on tighthead prop. Luan de Bruin and Joseph Dweba will be providing cover on the bench.
Tian Meyer will be leading the side with George Whitehead on flyhalf and Rabz Maxwane returning to play. Ruan Pienaar and Tian Schoeman are named as replacements.
Hawies Fourie’s side currently occupy a Final Series place, sitting third in Conference A and have never lost to Zebre.
Cheetahs’ head coach said: “We’re looking forward to start the year on the right foot. We’ve ended 2019 on a high note and we want a good start for 2020.”
“It is important for us to win this match. We are third on the log, two points ahead of Glasgow and they’ve played two games more than us. We’ll have to use the opportunity to stay in a good position on the log, while competing with Ulster for second position.
“The players had a much-needed break and they are excited about Saturday’s encounter.”
The following players are not eligible for team selection due to injury: Justin Basson (knee) and Charles Marais (bicep). While Dries Swanepoel and Jasper Wiese are currently on suspension.
