Proteas assistant coach Enoch Nkwe on Tuesday tempered some of the excitement surrounding AB de Villiers’ possible return to international cricket, pointing out that Mark Boucher, the national head coach, is far too organised in his outlook to just give him a free pass back.
The 35-year-old batsman earlier, after making his debut for Brisbane Heat in Australia’s Big Bash T20, had the cricket fraternity excited again after he revealed that he’d be open to playing for South Africa again in the World T20 later this year.
To his credit, De Villiers also said “a lot still needs to happen for that to become a reality”.

“It’s not going to be as simple as him just walking in to the dressing room,” said Nkwe from Port Elizabeth, where the Proteas are preparing for the third Test against England commencing from Thursday.
“From my experience working with Bouch these past few weeks, he’s a guy that believes in processes. AB’s also got to earn his spot.”
Yet Nkwe certainly isn’t denying the immense value that De Villiers to add to the national cause should he decided to involve himself again.

“If he had to be approached or show interest, AB would consider returning. I’m not too sure what’s happening, maybe it is something that’s being discussed behind-the-scenes,” he said.
“His commitment to local cricket has been shown in the Mzansi Super League and if we need experience like that, we’d be able to call on him I’m sure. He’d love to do it for his country.”
