Gaba says a call from a community member alerting emergency services to the fire was received at around 03:00.
“There is a school, Khutlo-Tharo Secondary, that has caught fire in the admin block. I am rushing to the scene to get details. We will issue a statement on further information later,” Gaba said.
Simon Nwamba, a journalist at the scene, told News24 that only the administration block was affected. Nwamba says community members gathered at the scene, witnessing the fire rage.
While it’s unclear what sparked the blaze, concerned parents and community members have questioned whether they may be dealing with a case of arson.
