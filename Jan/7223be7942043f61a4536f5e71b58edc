Canterbury batsman Leo Carter smashed his way into the record books after becoming the latest man to hit six sixes in a row.
The 25-year-old left-hander was playing in New Zealand’s local T20 tournament, the Super Smash, and ended with a whirlwind unbeaten 70 off just 29 balls.
He becomes only the sixth player in all professional cricket ever to achieve the feat.
West Indian Garry Sobers (1968) and India’s Ravi Shastri (1985) did so in first-class cricket, former Protea Herschelle Gibbs (2007) in that year’s 50-over World Cup, Indian Yuvraj Singh (2007) in the inaugural World T20 and Ross Whiteley (2017) and Hazratullah Zazai (2018) in domestic T20s.

Just over 24 hours later, Englishman Tom Banton did his utmost best to repeat Carter’s feat, hitting five consecutive sixes in a 19-ball 56 for the Brisbane Heat in Australia’s  Big Bash.
Rain reduced their match against the Sydney Thunder to just eight overs a side and Banton wasted little time during his special effort, the second quickest fifty in the tournament’s history.

This is just extraordinary.
