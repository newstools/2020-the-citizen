The tragic and disturbing drive-by shooting in Melville on New Year’s Day has shocked and saddened the Melville and Westdene communities.
At about 1am, patrons seeing in the new year at the popular Poppy’s restaurant came under fire, allegedly from one or more gunmen in a black BMW SUV.
Two women were declared dead at the scene.
After the incident, residents and patrons began placing flowers to honour the deceased and wounded.
