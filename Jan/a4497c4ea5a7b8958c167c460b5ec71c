Toyota has introduced another round of updates to its stalwart Land Cruiser 200 in the form of new creature comforts for the flagship VX.R only.
With the entry-level GX.R remaining unchanged, the new additions consists of a 14-speaker JBL sound system, a rear seat entertainment system made up of two 11.6-inch screens integrated into the rear seat, quad-zone climate control and a beige or black interior.

Standard specification is otherwise unchanged with the same applying to the drivetrain where the 4.5 D-4D V8 turbodiesel engine continues to punch-out 195kW/620Nm. A six-speed automatic gearbox is once more entrusted with routing the amount of power and torque to all four wheels.
Offered with a choice of six colours, the previous Attitude Black hue has been replaced with Sparkling Black Pearl, while Sunset Dune and Midnight Blue have been dropped altogether.

A three year/100 000 km warranty and nine-service/90 000 km service plan is standard on both models with the GX.R retailing from R1 086 200 and the VX.R from R1 510 000.
