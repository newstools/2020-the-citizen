After reading about slain baby Siyabonga Buthelezi’s story, Reiger Park-based Patrick Pietersen Funeral Services took it upon itself to bury little Siya with dignity, they told Boksburg Advertiser.
This comes after the family made an appeal to funeral parlours, bus companies and food stores to help bury their son due their financial constraints.
Siyabonga, who was 11 months old, died in hospital on January 3 after being shot by a stray bullet when suspected rival gangs allegedly opened fire at each other in Windmill Park.

Patrick Pietersen, the owner of the funeral services, said when he heard about the tragedy, he felt the need to reach out to the bereaved family.
“I was very much touched by the story because I am also a father and grandfather. I couldn’t just sit and do nothing because I know the loss of a loved one is never easy,” Pietersen said.
He highlighted that they would assist with the necessary documentation, flowers, a coffin, grave, tent, pamphlets and funeral vehicles.
In the midst of her grief, Siyabonga’s mother, Uzelle Maine, expressed her sincere gratitude to the funeral services for responding to their appeal.
“We have received enormous condolences messages from the public and we appreciate it,” Maine said.
Anyone who can assist may contact the family on 084 236 4456 or 074 575 8812, or Leon Rooi (community leader) on 079 984 5044.
