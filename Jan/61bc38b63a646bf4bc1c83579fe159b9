Having updated the standard Civic last year, Honda has now unveiled the subtly tweaked Type R on the first day of the Tokyo Auto Salon.
While the external changes are limited to a larger grille and a new colour option dubbed Boost Blue, the majority of the revisions are reserved for underneath the skin where Honda has equipped the Type R with a revised front suspension, upgraded brake pads with new two-piece rotors, stiffer rear bushings and updated dampers.
Like its exterior, the Type R’s new interior accommodations are minor and limited to a new Alcantara wrapped steering wheel and restyled gear knob, as well as Honda’s Sensing suite of safety and driver assistance systems.
Unchanged is the drivetrain where the 2.0-litre turbocharged engine once again produces 228kW/400Nm and comes mated to a close-ratio six-speed manual gearbox. Retaining the Comfort, Sport and +R driving modes, it now comes with Active Sound Control that is claimed to adjust the engine’s soundtrack inside the cabin depending on the selected mode.
At present, no local launch date or indeed availability has been confirmed.
