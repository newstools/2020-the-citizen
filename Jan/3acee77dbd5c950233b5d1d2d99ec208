Shown at the Geneva Motor Show two years ago, Audi South Africa has finally announced pricing details for the all-new A6, as well as the fire-breathing S6.
Carrying the internal moniker C8 and riding on the same MLB Evo platform as the A4, Q7, Q8, Bentley Bentayga, Lamborghini Urus and Volkswagen Touareg, the A6 is both wider and slightly taller than the model it replaces, and according to the automaker’s online configurator, will be available with two TDI engines and in sedan guise only.
Opening the line-up is the 40 TDI S tronic that utilises the familiar 2.0-litre oil burner delivering 140kW/400Nm. As its name indicates, a seven-speed S tronic transmission sends the amount of twist to the front wheels, with Audi claiming a top speed of 237 km/h and 0-100 km/h in 8.4 seconds.

Sitting at the top of the range and arriving at a later stage is the 45 TDI whose 3.0-litre V6 motor produces 183kW/500Nm While no performance details were revealed, the website confirms it will feature quattro all-wheel-drive and most likely the eight-speed Tiptronic gearbox.
At present, the website only lists specification for the 40 TDI which consists of 10-spoke Aero cast alloy 18-inch wheels, LED headlights, dual-zone climate control, ambient lighting, centre front armrest, electric front seats with memory function for the driver’s chair, the MMI Navigation Plus infotainment system with smartphone interface, the Audi Drive Select system, the Virtual Cockpit Display instrument cluster, cruise control and a choice of four upholstery finishes.

Form the options list, buyers can choose from two combined packages; the Comfort (R30 000) and Sport (R29 200), as well as individual features such as the Matrix HD LED headlights with combination rear LEDs (R36 000), a panoramic glass sunroof (R21 000), surround view camera system (R11 850), Lane Change Warning with rear cross traffic alert (R14 200), Adaptive Cruise Control (R22 400), Auto High Beam Assist (R2 380), Heads-Up Display (R24 400), Night Vision Assistant (R37 800), a 3D Bang & Olufsen sound system (R15 200) and wheel sizes ranging from 19-21-inches.
A total of 12 colours can be had; two solids in Ibis White and Brilliant Black and ten metallic hues; Glacier White, Floret Silver, Typhoon Grey, Myth Black, Soho Brown, Vesuvius Grey, Seville Red, Firmament Blue, Navarra Blue and Tango Red.

Capping the range off is the S6 which eschews the 257kW/700Nm 3.0 TDI V6 engine offered in Europe, for the 2.9 TFSI mild-hybrid petrol that makes 331kW/600Nm. Mated to the seven-speed S tronic transmission, the S6 will sprint from 0-100 km/h in 4.5 seconds and top out at 250 km/h. As ever, drive is send to all four wheels.

Standard spec consists of 20-inch Audi Sport five-spoke alloy wheels, the Matrix LED headlights, heated and cooled sport seats trimmed in Valcona leather or Alcantara/leather, quad-zone climate control, aluminium inlays, contoured ambient lighting, S sport suspension, red painted brake calipers and the mentioned Bang & Olufsen sound system.
Bespoke options consist of a black appearance package (R10 450), 21-inch alloys (R16 000), S sport front seats (R17 400), Adaptive Air suspension (R15 700), Dynamic all-wheel steering (R27 400) and a sports optimised differential (R27 400).

With the bigger engine A6’s sticker price unconfirmed for now, pricing for the 40 TDI kicks-off at R885 000 sans options, while the S6 retails from R1 353 800. A five year/100 000 km Freeway Plan is standard on both.
