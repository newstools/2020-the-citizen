A 53-year-old pastor was arrested on Tuesday following allegations that he had raped a four-year-old girl inside a toilet, reports Boksburg Advertiser.
According to the Reiger Park SAPS report, the child’s mother opened a case in November last year after it came to her attention that the pastor had allegedly sexually harassed her child.
The child’s name and her mother’s name are being withheld to protect their identities.
Police investigated the allegations and arrested the suspect, charging him with rape.
The matter is being investigated by the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS).
The pastor is expected to appear in the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court this week.
