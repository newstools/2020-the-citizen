On course to make its official debut next year, the highly awaited W223 generation Mercedes-Benz S-Class has gone viral in a single disguise-free image on social media.
Despite having made the rounds on various online platforms since 2018 undergoing testing wearing extensive layers of camouflage, and even pre-production body panels, the solitary snap leaked by the CocheSpias Instagram page shows the S-Class parked on what appears to be a factory floor with its bonnet open.
In spite of its roof being obscured by the factory’s ducting system, the picture nonetheless reveals an evolution of the GLE and GLS’ design language, with the headlights being rounder and the grille less integrated into the front facia than the current W222 (main image).
Although not pictured, prior spy shots has confirmed that the S-Class’ interior will be radically different and consist of not only the wide all-digital instrument cluster, but an expansive tablet-like infotainment system on the centre console. In terms of equipment, the S-Class is set to usher-in a new array of features, as well as safety and driver assistance tech, although little about these are known at present.
Underneath, and according to carscoops.com, the S-Class will become the latest model to ride on Benz’s MRA platform and come powered by a selection of 48-volt mild-hybrid EQ Boost straight-six and V8 petrol engines, with a plug-in hybrid set to be included as well.
While it remains to be seen whether a diesel engine will remain part of the range, an engine that will continue is the three-pointed star’s bi-turbo V12 that will once again serve as the biggest displacement option available. Naturally, a brace of AMG models will follow along with coupe and cabriolet bodystyles.
