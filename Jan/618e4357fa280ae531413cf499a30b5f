Poised to debut sometime next year, the second generation Toyota GT86 will not only adopt turbocharging for the first time, but sport a new name in the form of GR86.
While it was reported by the Japan Times as far back as 2018 that the GT86, and its mechanically identical twin, the Subaru BRZ, will come with more power, Britain’s Autocar has seemingly confirmed that the 2.0-litre normally aspirated motor will make way for the bigger 2.4-litre engine that powers the Legacy, Outback and US-market Ascent SUV, but with a forced assistance not free breathing as initially reported.
Part of Subaru’s FA family, the engine, which Best Car claims will be detuned from 191 kW in the above mentioned models to 162 kW, will be less powerful than the 190 kW 2.0-litre motor that powers the Supra SZ-R in Japan, but produce 17 kW more than the entry-level SZ model using the same engine.
In spite of keeping the existing rear-wheel-drive layout, the British publication states that both will move to Toyota’s TNGA’s platform as Subaru’s own Global Platform has not been optimised for said arraignment.
As indicated, the GT86 will be renamed to GR86 as part of Toyota’s rollout of more GR models. It will therefore join the Supra and the recently launched Yaris GR as the third dedicated Gazoo Racing model. The name change will however not be expanded to the BRZ.
