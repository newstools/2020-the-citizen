Parents and clothing retailers are in the middle of a back-to-school slump, with the former under pressure to ensure their children are well-stocked and the latter noticing a decrease in sales.
One mother, Sufiyya Khan, said she has four children, each going to different schools.
“Uniforms, especially the shoes, are more expensive because my kids are starting new schools this year,” she said.
It will also be a juggling act to ensure the children have everything on their list of stationery, Khan said.
Charity Ngoma, a mother of two, described the pressure, especially with having more than one child. “School uniforms are quite expensive but there is nothing which can be done as kids have to go back to school.”
Her daughter is starting Grade R this year and she is happy the government sees to half of the stationery, lessening the pressure.
Edwin Moila, a father of three, has a son who is starting high school.
“Stationery is very expensive; we budget almost R5,000 for stationery, which includes books.”
Shopowner Chris van den Berg in Randburg yesterday said this was usually their busiest time of the year, but things appear to be quieter of late. Another uniform supplier in Fordsburg experienced a similar decline in sales.
Economist Dawie Roodt said a cause for the decrease in sales from clothing manufacturers is due to the country’s economic downturn. Roodt said the decrease in sales was to be expected.
“Parents are not able to spend as much as before on school uniforms and stationery, because of not having enough money to cover all the costs,” Roodt said.
