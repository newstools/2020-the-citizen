Siya Kolisi believes his much-publicised association with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation Sports will “allow him to give back to South Africa”.
The Springbok skipper, who joined the rapper’s management company last month, was on hand at the weekend to have a chat with SuperSport during the second Test between the Proteas and England at Newlands.
“Roc Nation will expand my brand off the field,” Kolisi told the broadcaster.
“I’ve told them what’s important to me and they’ve assured me that every company that associates with me will give back to our country.”
The powerful flanker also revealed that he’s currently busy planning the development of various sport fields with Vincent Mai, the man who bankrolled his school bursary.
