Democratic Alliance (DA) MP Cameron Mackenzie has been shot and injured in an attempted robbery.
“This act of senseless violence reminds us all that the fight against crime remains one of our top priorities. Our thoughts are with Cameron and his family, and indeed with all South Africans, who have suffered at the hands of criminals for far too long!” the party said in a statement on Twitter.
The DA MP was shot in the shoulder outside Dainfern Ridge Estate in Midrand, north of Johannesburg on Tuesday morning.
DA Gauteng provincial chairperson Mike Moriarty told Jacaranda FM he was recovering well, adding that the incident highlighted the general lack of safety in South Africa.
“We will continue to support him and pray for recovery very soon,” says Moriarty.
Police are searching for the suspects, with spokesperson Mathapelo Peter indicating that a red VW Golf is believed to have followed Mackenzie to the complex.
“A struggle between the victim and suspect ensued, and a shot was allegedly fired by the suspect, striking the victim on his upper body,” Peter said, after which the suspect escaped in the Gold.
