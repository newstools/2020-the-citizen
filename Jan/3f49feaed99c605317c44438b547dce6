After decades of aspiring towards it, for my sins I today find myself working as a professional writer. I’m based at a PR agency, but I also do work for outside clients, usually writing and ghostwriting books. I’ve also edited magazines, written screenplays for movies and TV and typed a bunch of articles and columns. I decided, since it is probably my only real competence, I am probably qualified to cobble together a few writing tips. I also certainly have better credentials to write about writing than about being topless on a dinner date, Uber-ride overshares and snogging older ladies...
