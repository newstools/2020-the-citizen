After Gauteng human settlements, urban planning, and cooperative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta) MEC Lebogang Maile suspended Tshwane speaker Katlego Mathebe and Johannesburg speaker Vasco Da Gama, the DA has both condemned and threatened legal action against Maile.
Threatening to take Maile to court, the party described Maile’s decision to put both speakers on suspension as political harassment, arguing that Maile could not suspend or remove a councillor from office without obtaining a council resolution.
In a statement, the party vowed to not give in to his “bullying tactics”.
“We have instructed our lawyers to approach the courts on an urgent basis to review this illegal move. We have also written to the MEC to invite him to retract his unlawful decision, failing which we will apply for a personal and punitive cost order against Maile.
“When former Emfuleni mayor Simon Mofokeng was accused of spending more than R1.7 million of public money on KFC, Nandos, and hotels, he was not fired or suspended for misconduct. Moreover, the former mayor of eThekwini, Zandile Gumede who has been implicated in fraud and corruption was also not removed from office or suspended under clause 14(6). There are many such instances, including the new mayor of Johannesburg, Geoff Makhubo.”
Both Mathebe and Da Gama were announced to have been suspended without pay on Thursday. Mathebe was suspended for six months and Da Gama suspended for three months.
