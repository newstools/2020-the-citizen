According to a family member, Mosa Maluleke, his cousin was stabbed during a mugging. It is alleged that a person attempted to take his cellphone and, in fighting back, Thorisho was stabbed several times.
Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed the incident and said the deceased succumbed to his injuries in hospital.
A petition, Justice for Thoriso ‘Forklift’ Noko Kgomo’, has since been created calling for social media users to help fight for justice.
