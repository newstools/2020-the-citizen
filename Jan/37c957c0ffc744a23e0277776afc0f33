Protesters have returned to Parktown Boys’ High School for the second day to stand in solidarity with the family of Enock Mpianzi, reports Rosebank Killarney Gazette.
Veteran journalist Karima Brown put a call out on social media on Monday for those seeking to fight for justice to be delivered after the passing of the grade 8 learner.
A small group gathered on Tuesday morning and vowed to return until the truth was revealed.

A few members of the media questioned Brown’s motives surrounding the protest. Despite this, Brown and three other people have arrived for the second day on Wednesday.
