BMW is reportedly toying with the idea of breathing new life into the dormant 6 Series moniker as a rival for the Porsche 911.
Dropped in 2017 for the 8 Series, but revived soon after as a replacement for the much criticised fastback-styled 5 Series Gran Turismo, BMW Design boss, Adrian Hooydonk, in a short worded statement with Britain’s Autocar, merely said, “It’s a nice idea. Maybe we should work on that”.
A year before its eventual demise, Britain’s Auto Express reported that the 6 Series was being re-focused as a rival for not only the 911, but also the Mercedes-AMG GT with the then still-born 8 Series fulfilling the role of the brand’s flagship GT.
Although the publication reported at the time that the 6 Series would most likely have ride on the same platform as the Toyota Supra, the decision was eventually overturned in favour of the Z4 in spite of the architectures’ inherent flexibility to accommodate more than a single model.
