Rabada and Dean Elgar, known for his own hard brand of cricket, were standing at the front of the entrance to the teams’ dressing rooms as they shook hands with the winning English players.
After the formalities were done, Rabada clearly catches Elgar off-guard by knocking him in the, erm, “nether regions”!
