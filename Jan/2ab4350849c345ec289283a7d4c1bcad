Musician Chicco Twala’s son Longwe failed to appear in the Booysens Magistrate’s Court, where he was expected on Wednesday. A prosecutor confirmed to IOL that Longwe was a no-show in court and the case was postponed to next month.
Longwe was apprehended after he allegedly failed to produce a receipt to a security guard at a popular grocery store chain at The Glen Shopping Centre after he allegedly stole toiletries valued at R200.
The alleged theft reportedly happened on 18 October 2019 and Twala was seen picking up a Gillet razor, which he carried with him to a different aisle where he concealed the item, before heading out of the store without paying.
Upon noticing this, the store’s security guard ran after Twala and asked him to produce a receipt for the goods. When he couldn’t, he was then detained.
Twala made headlines recently after an old video surfaced of his father lambasting him at a police station.
Text superimposed over the video states “voice of Chicco Twala at Diepkloof police station where he handed his son Longwe Twala to the police for stealing”.
Chicco opens the video by telling Longwe that he wishes it was him who killed Senzo Meyiwa so that he could rot in jail.
He then proceeds to swear at Longwe before telling him that his behaviour and actions have destroyed his (Chicco’s) name.
“Everyone when they see Chicco Twala, they see a criminal, they see a drug lord, they see all this sh**,” screams Twala.
“Put a bullet in him, if he runs away, shoot him,” added Twala in response to a female voice in the background who says that Longwe will run away.
