Enock died during a school orientation camp for grade 8 pupils at Nyati Bush and Riverbreak Lodge in North West last week after the makeshift raft he had built with other boys in his group overturned and his disappearance went unnoticed for 17 hours.
His body was found 3km downstream on Friday morning.
Lesufi confirmed that a police investigation into the incident had already been initiated.
