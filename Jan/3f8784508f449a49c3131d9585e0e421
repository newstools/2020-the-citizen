Steyn slots straight into Bulls starting XV
Veteran former Springbok flyhalf Morne Steyn has forced himself into the Bulls’ starting line-up for their Super Rugby opener against the Sharks in Durban on Friday evening.
The 35-year-old’s game management skills will be crucial in a game that’s expected to be attritional given the weather and the nature of an early South African derby.
There’s further experience with Scottish international Josh Strauss making his debut in blue, while Pumas loanee Jeandre Rudolph has impressed enough to slot straight into the first XV.
Notably, the Springbok duo of Lizo Gqoboka and Trevor Nyakane are back, though only the former will start.
Bulls: Warrick Gelant, Cornal Hendricks, Johnny Kotze, Burger Odendaal (c), Rosko Specman, Morne Steyn, Ivan van Zyl, Josh Strauss, Abongile Nonkontwana, Jeandre Rudolph, Juandre Kruger, Andries Ferreira, Wiehahn Herbst, Jaco Visagie, Lizo Gqoboka. Bench: Johan Grobbelaar, Simphiwe Matanzima, Trevor Nyakane, Ruan Nortje, Ryno Pieterse, Wian Vosloo, Embrose Papier, Manie Libbok.

Rohit Sharma smacked a six off the final ball of a dramatic super over for India to win the third Twenty20 against New Zealand in Hamilton on Wednesday and wrap up the series.
Sharma had earlier starred for India with 65 after they were sent into bat first and reached 179 for five.
New Zealand, desperate to stay in the five-match series after losing games one and two, matched India at 179 for six on the back of a majestic 95 by captain Kane Williamson.
Williamson scored 11 of New Zealand’s 17 runs batting first in the super over.
India only scored eight off the first four deliveries in reply before Sharma smacked back-to-back sixes to claim the match and the series.

“I’ve done well at other tournaments and in other matches but could never break that barrier in Grand Slams. You can’t imagine what this means to me.

Farrell picks ‘hell of a team’ for Ireland’s Six Nations opener
Ireland head coach Andy Farrell said he had selected “a hell of a team” for the Six Nations opener against Scotland this weekend after opting for Conor Murray over John Cooney at scrumhalf.
The choice between the experience of Murray and the outstanding form of Cooney was the biggest call facing Farrell for what will be his first match in charge of Ireland since succeeding Joe Schmidt.
Farrell has opted to show faith in 78-cap Munster player Murray, with the 29-year-old Cooney among the replacements, despite a series of fine displays for Ulster.
Uncapped Caelan Doris, a former Ireland Under-20s captain, has been rewarded with a start at No 8.
“You’ve got to make a decision and we’ve got a hell of a team going into Scotland,” the English former dual code international added.
Ireland: Jordan Larmour, Andrew Conway, Garry Ringrose, Bundee Aki, Jacob Stockdale; Johnny Sexton (c), Conor Murray; Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier, CJ Stander; James Ryan, Iain Henderson; Tadhg Furlong, Rob Herring, Cian Healy. Bench: Ronan Kelleher, Dave Kilcoyne, Andrew Porter, Devin Toner, Peter O’Mahony, John Cooney, Ross Byrne, Robbie Henshaw. – AFP.
