Tiger Woods took a break from his own busy schedule to caddie for his son Charlie at the weekend.
The ten-year-old finished ninth in the junior event that took place in Jupiter, Florida, but everyone was in awe of the youngster’s magnificent swing after one of his drives were captured on video and shared widely on social media.
It’s quite a thing of beauty, reinforcing the truth behind the old cliche that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.


Woods is very fond of Charlie, having turned to him first when he memorably won The Masters last year and embracing him heartily.
On this evidence, it won’t be long until a new Woods dominates world golf.
