A racegoer invaded the track during the last race at Cranbourne racecourse in Australia on Friday and narrowly avoided being hit by runners as they rounded the home bend.
The invader, a shirtless man, jumped the rail just before the race began, not far from the finish line, and was tackled by a security guard.
With the help of a friend he wriggled away after a scuffle and ran back towards the runners as they rounded the home bend, narrowly being missed by them, before hopping back over the rail and being congratulated by his friend.
Fortunately, the horses continued unscathed and there was no disruption to the race. The Cranbourne Turf Club is calling for the individuals involved to be banned from attending racecourses for life.
Club CEO Neil Bainbridge said: “It’s the club’s view that the individuals involved should be banned from all Victorian racecourses. “The behaviour is totally unacceptable. Jockey safety and horse welfare are non-negotiable paramounts at the Cranbourne Turf Club and we will do everything we can to ensure these people are not only not welcome at the Cranbourne Turf Club but at any racetrack in Victoria.”Victoria Police have copies of the footage provided by Thoroughbred Racing Productions (TRP).
“When we review the footage, we will either release it on social media, which has its positives and negatives or to bring it to some people who we know to try to identify the group.”
Bainbridge said he was happy with the performance of the security team, one of whom was reported to have been assaulted in the incident.
He added: “Unless we had two-metre-high outside fences we couldn’t stop this situation. From what I understand security was right on hand and did everything they could.”
