Closely following the leaked images of the restyled Fortuner last week, first pictures of the updated Toyota Hilux undergoing testing has popped-up on social media.
Posted by the New Fortuner Club Thailand Facebook page, and subsequently also by motor1.com Brazil, the snaps reveal very little as all of  the likely production models are decked-out in heavy layers of black-of-white camouflage.
Based on the latter’s claims, the Hilux will receive a new grille, redesigned head-and-taillights and on the inside, the expected same upgraded materials and infotainment system mulled for the Fortuner. As evident by the images, the Hilux will again be offered in xtra and double cab bodystyles, with the single cab set to continue as well.
The status quo will be unchanged up  front where the current 2.4 and 2.8 GD-6 turbodiesel engines, as well as the long-serving 2.7 and 4.0-litre V6 petrol motors will more than likely continue, but with a hybrid drivetrain joining at some stage as part of Toyota’s aim of having  all of its models electrified by 2025. Transmission will also be kept as is in the shape of a five-or-six-speed manual, and the six-speed automatic.
Unknown though is whether the recent filing of a trademark application in Australia for the GR Hilux moniker would result in a rival for the Ford Ranger Raptor becoming an official reality, with a similar mystery surrounding a possible V6 oil-burner Toyota Argentina President, Daniel Herrero, allegedly alluded to in 2018.
