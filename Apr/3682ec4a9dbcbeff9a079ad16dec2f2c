South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday poked fun at himself for clumsily fumbling with his face mask during televised speech, a move that attracted widespread laughter on social media.
The president awkwardly pulled a colourful fabric mask over his eyes after announcing an easing of lockdown restrictions on Thursday night, prompting instant reactions on Twitter by amused viewers.
The hashtags #facemaskchallenge and #CyrilMaskChallenge were trending on Friday as South Africans humoured their president by posting captioned images of Ramaphosa and pictures of themselves in impromptu face coverings.

Haha, I love him. So dope to see the No.1 cititzen loosening up. He deserves to smile & laugh a bit cause he’s been under so much pressure. He has shown great leadership skills in these tough times. Lead us Rre Ramaphosa, we are behind you. #cyrilramaphosa #CyrilRamaphosaFaceMask pic.twitter.com/Fkd09adW1O

“For those who were laughing at me yesterday, let me tell you something,” Ramaphosa told reporters during a hospital tour on Friday.
“I am going to open a TV channel where I will teach people how to put on a mask,” he chuckled. “You can enrol.”
Ramaphosa’s mask incident lightened the mood in a country entering the fifth week of a strict nationwide lockdown and where the number of coronavirus cases — 3,953 to date — is the highest in Africa.

South Africans have a quick & warm sense of humour. We laugh with each other not at each other. It gets us through our toughest times. It’s our strength. #CyrilRamaBillion #CyrilMaskChallenge #cyrilramaphosa #CyrilFridays

“Kudos to our president,” said one Twitter post. “At least he’s got a sense of humour.”

Let he who has not struggled with their mask throw the first stone #cyrilramaphosa
