Honda Motor South Africa has thrown its support behind the BR-V after the models’ rumoured axing in India become official at the beginning of this month.
In a statement, the automaker’s General Manager of Automobiles, Dinesh Govender, said the BR-V, which received a subtle facelift in February, will not be phased out as it serves as “one of our pillar models”.
“Honda Motor Southern Africa has no plans to discontinue the BR-V and is currently securing sufficient stock of the BR-V from India while the alternate factory is being set up for production,” Govender said.
“[It] is currently the only seven-seater sport utility vehicle (SUV) in its price class. This affords the BR-V a significant advantage over its competitors, and consistently makes it one of our top two best-sellers in South Africa along with the Amaze compact sedan”.
Its discontinuing coming as a result of poor sales and the implementing of the new BS6 emissions regulations, for which neither the 1.5-litre petrol or 1.5-litre turbodiesel engine were adapted, it remains to be seen whether the BR-V would now be sourced from Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia or Pakistan Plants and if it would be cheaper or pricier than the outgoing Indian model.
