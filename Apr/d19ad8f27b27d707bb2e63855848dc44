With the above incidents, the total number of criminal activities was now at 55 since the beginning of the lockdown.
Valuable equipment and school nutrition groceries were stolen during the burglaries.
“It seems that these criminals are not bothered and they don’t have a sense of the damage they are causing to the future of our children and our country because, without education, we are doomed, the future is bleak. Indeed the coarse behaviour of these criminals is annoying and they must be apprehended and face the law,” said Lesufi.
“This is to reiterate our plea for protection of our schools, and the community is encouraged to always report criminal activities in their areas to the law enforcement agencies for a swift response,” added Lesufi.
