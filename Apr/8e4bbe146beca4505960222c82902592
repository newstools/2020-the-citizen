Malajila revealed he received an offer from Orlando Pirates before joining Mamelodi Sundowns. The Pretoria outfit hijacked the deal at the last minute. Malajila spent six years with the Brazilians where he enjoyed little game time and eventually released when his contract expired.
Malajila won four league titles and Caf Champions League trophy with Sundowns before leaving the club.
The 34-year-old is currently a free agent after he was released by Black Leopards in January.
“I was set to join Orlando Pirates and terms had been agreed only for Mamelodi Sundowns to sneak in with a better offer at the 11th hour and I was off to Pretoria,” Malajila was quoted by the Chronicle.
“Looking at what I won, I have no regrets. The stay at Sundowns gave me fame and success, adding colour to my career.”
