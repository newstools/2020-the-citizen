Police in KwaZulu-Natal arrested seven suspects for robbery after police seized stolen property, including liquor.
Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said the arrest came after the police were in the early hours of Wednesday notified about a robbery at a tavern. He said the tavern was on Chris Hani Road in Briardene.
Naicker said the four suspects allegedly held up the security guard at the tavern and allegedly forced him into the guard room where he was bound.
“They then proceeded to cut the burglar bars to gain entry into the premises. The suspects stole two flat-screen TV sets and alcohol from the premises. Thereafter they fled on foot into a nearby informal settlement. Police were immediately notified and promptly arrived at the crime scene.
“Police officers searched the area and spotted the men consuming liquor in the informal settlement. Following further investigation, they directed police officers to a house where some of the stolen property was found hidden. Police seized liquor and other items found in the suspects’ possession.”
Naicker said the police expected to make more arrests as investigations continue.
He said the seven suspects would be profiled to determine whether they were linked to other robberies in the province.
The men are expected to appear at the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Thursday, he added.
KwaZulu-Natal Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula welcomed the arrest of the suspects and commended the swift response and investigation by police officers from Greenwood Park, Durban North.
