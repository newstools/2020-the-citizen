“I grew up supporting Kaizer Chiefs by the way. People don’t know that. I don’t hate Kaizer Chiefs, but they are my competition. It is nothing personal,” Mosimane was quoted as saying by Independent Media.
“I know a lot of people don’t like some of the things I say about them (Chiefs), but we are rivals in the league. I also talked about Orlando Pirates in the same way when we were competing for the league for the past two seasons. Not that I hated them. It is competition, nothing personal.
“The reason Mamelodi Sundowns supporters feel that (Ernst) Middendorp doesn’t like them is because he also doesn’t talk nice about us. People must understand that we are competing,” Mosimane added.
Before the league action was halted by the coronavirus pandemic, Chiefs were top of the standings. They are four points ahead of defending champions Sundowns, but the Brazilians have a game in hand over Amakhosi.
Winning that game will see them reduce the deficit to one point.
“It is not nice when there’s just one team that is winning. We need competition,” concluded Mosimane.
