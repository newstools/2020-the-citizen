In what now seems to be an official confirmation, Ford has rebuked claims by its Australian division about the future of the Focus RS, saying that an all-new model based on the current fourth generation Focus won’t be happening anytime soon.
Confirming a report last week from French online publication, Caradisiac, an unnamed spokesperson for the Blue Oval has reiterated comments made back in February to Britain’s Autocar that development costs and tougher emissions regulations have made a business case for the RS non-existent and not worth committing to.
“As a result of pan-European emissions standards, increased CO2 taxation and the high cost of developing an RS with some form of electrification for a relatively low volume of vehicles, we are not planning another RS version of the Focus,” the publication quoted the spokesperson as saying.
On course to have debuted in 2022 reportedly powered by a hybrid powertrain combining the 2.5-litre turbocharged engine from the Kuga with an electric motor for a total system output of 298 kW, the RS’ ruling out leaves the ST as the most powerful Focus offering in Dearborn line-up. Like the Fiesta ST however, the Focus and its ST sibling have been ruled out for South Africa due to pricing concerns as well as slumping sales.
