An Australian allegedly caught driving a Lamborghini at nearly twice the speed limit in Sydney claimed he was rushing to hospital to be tested for coronavirus, police said Wednesday.
The man was undergoing mandatory self-isolation after being pulled over for allegedly driving 160 kilometres per hour in a 90 km/h zone on Monday.
Police urged Australians who suspect they may have Covid-19 to call their nearest medical service first.
“Drivers shouldn’t break the road rules under any circumstances,” Assistant Commissioner Michael Corboy said.
“If you think you may have symptoms of Covid-19 and want to seek help from a doctor or hospital, call ahead of time to book an appointment.
“If you are experiencing a medical emergency, contact triple zero.”
Police said the 35-year-old man had been tested for coronavirus and was now undergoing mandatory self-isolation.
It was unclear whether or not he had tested positive.
