Although innumerable people throughout the world have elected to entertain themselves be rewatching movies such as the 2011 film Contagion, those who have seen it do not seem to think it was a good idea for the SABC to broadcast it to the millions of South Africans who are staying home to help flatten the curve.

Catch Contagion on @SABC3 tonight at 21:30, watch the movie to see the importance of quarantine against a pandemic like COVID-19 pic.twitter.com/ZPsRdg4MTB

According to tweets sent by the SABC’s various accounts as well as discussions on the public broadcaster’s various radio stations, the decision to show the movie was inspired by a need to help the masses better understand the spread of a virus.
Contagion is a 2011 American thriller film directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film, inspired by pandemics such as the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak and the 2009 flu pandemic, depicts the spread of a virus transmitted by fomites, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease and the loss of social order in the face of a pandemic. It also shows the introduction of a vaccine to halt its spread.
The film also stars an ensemble cast in the form of Marion Cotillard, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Bryan Cranston, Jennifer Ehle, and Sanaa Lathan.
Shortly after its release, the film was praised by critics for its narrative and the performances. It was also well received by scientists, who lauded its accuracy.
Following its broadcast as Sunday night’s movie on SABC 3, however, the film seemed to have spread more fear than knowledge. It also spurred some bizarre conspiracy theories.

I don't think having the masses watch #contagion is the best decision. Yeah it'll help people take the coronavirus more seriously but it could also amp up hysteria.. Especially considering the fact that the lockdown being extended is soon to be confirmed.#SABC

So #BillGates has instructed you to spread fear about the #coronavirius outbreak so as we all accept his Vaccines. No, it will not work! Your timing says it all.We refuse to be VACCINATED! #AfricansAreNotLabRats #AfricanIsNotAnExperiment

Some of you believe that Bill Gates pressured the SABc to play Contangion? pic.twitter.com/facYP6XGYH

That's a bit of an exaggeration to say it helps you understand. It's the usual drama, with the magical survival of the hero. Worst is the way the vaccine is found. Utterly fake! 12-18 months, the experts are guessing! #StayHomeSaveLives
