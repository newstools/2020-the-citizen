The occupants were questioned and revealed that they had bought the liquor at a nearby shebeen.
Officers were led there and uncovered the alcohol worth R1.5 million on the property.
The owner of the shebeen as well as the three men in the car were arrested for contravening the regulations of the Disaster Management Act, which prohibits the sale of liquor during the nationwide lockdown aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
They are expected in the local magistrate’s court on Monday.
