The apparent certainty surrounding the next generation Toyota GT86 has taken another unexpected twist with a new report from Japan alleging that it will indeed be normally aspirated.
Last month, a leaked product slide and accompanying post stated that the GT86, which will be renamed to GR86, will use the same 191 kW version of the 2.4-litre turbocharged FA engine found in several North American Subaru models, and debut in July next year still sporting rear-wheel-drive and with a manual or automatic transmission.
In the latest rebuttal however, Japan’s Best Car alleges that the GT86 will keep the mentioned flat-four engine, but do without the turbocharger, thus confirming the claim it made last year that the GT86 will remain a free breathing model.
Without the blower, power drops from 191kW/376Nm to 162kW/240Nm, outputs mentioned in said report, while transmissions will continue to include a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. Based on Best Car’s claims, the GT86 will measure 4 250 mm in overall length with a wheelbase of 2 570 mm, height of 1 315 mm and width of 1 780 mm.
In a further contradiction of what has seemingly been an open secret, the GR86 is now anticipated to premiere as early as March next year with its Subaru BRZ sibling set to follow soon after.
