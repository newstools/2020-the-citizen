With the wraps having come off of the Yaris Cross last week, Toyota is reportedly mulling an expansion of crossover/SUV inspired models with the Corolla allegedly being next in inline.
Responding to the infamous product presentation slide leaked by the Allcarnews Instagram page page earlier this month, Australia’s carsguide.com.au has alleged that the unnamed CUV planned for the third quarter of next year will in fact be based on the current Corolla hatch and likely carry the Corolla Cross designation.
Given the significant revisions applied to the Yaris Cross compared to the standard model on the outside and underneath, expect the Corolla Cross to be similarly adapted and perhaps offer the option of all-wheel-drive. It will otherwise offer the same choice of engines and transmissions as the ‘standard’ Corolla.
According to the publication, the Cross will rival the likes of the Hyundai Kona and Kia Seltos, but it remains to be seen how it will be priced and positioned relatively to the C-HR. More details are expected to emerge in the coming weeks and months.
