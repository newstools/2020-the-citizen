A 32-year-old man was arrested in Tzaneen, Limpopo on Tuesday after he was allegedly caught in possession of illicit cigarettes, sexual enhancing pills and cars worth almost R2 million, according to the South African Police Service (SAPS).
In an intelligence-driven operation, officers were led to a house in the CBD, spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said.
“After a search was conducted at this house, 84 boxes containing illicit cigarettes, 1,319 sexual performance-enhancing pills and a cash amount of more than R60,000 were recovered.
“Furthermore, four vehicles, a Ford Ranger, Audi, Chrysler and Hyundai Elantra were confiscated. All the recovered goods are worth over R1.5 million,” Mojapelo said.
The man is expected to appear in the Tzaneen Magistrate’s Court on Thursday for the contravention of the Medicines and Related Substances Control Act, selling unregistered sexual enhancement medicine and the possession of illicit cigarettes, Mojapelo said.
