Two French medical professionals have been slammed by social media users for discussing testing Covid-19 vaccines in Africa live on television. 
French TV channel LCI broadcast a discussion between doctors Jean-Paul Mira and Camille Locht, Business Insider reported. 
In the segment, which has since gone viral, the two doctors engage in a back-and-forth discussion about whether to do the study in Africa, “where there are no masks, no treatment, no reanimation,” according to Mira. 
Locht responds by agreeing with Mira, saying that talks of a “parallel study” taking place with “BCG Placebos”, and that a request for a proposal to be put together has been received, but may not have formally been released yet.

The video prompted the Twitter trend #AfricansAreNotLabRats on Saturday, in which Twitter users question why two doctors in Europe not look at testing vaccines on their own populations, which have experienced a far higher death toll during the Covid-19 pandemic than Africa. 

Spain has recorded 11744 Deaths
Italy has recorded 14681 Deaths
China recorded 3314 Deaths
USA recorded 7146 Deaths
France has recorded 6490 Deaths
The whole Africa has not recorded up to 50 Deaths. Yet they are bringing Vaccine to Africa for testing. #AfricansAreNotLabRats

Others called the doctors’ proposal racist, denouncing their “provocative” discussion.

The trend also grabbed the attention of former Ivorian Chelsea striker Didier Drogba, who said he “vividly denounce[d] those demeaning, false and most of all deeply racists words.”

It is totally inconceivable we keep on cautioning this.Africa isn’t a testing lab.I would like to vividly denounce those demeaning, false and most of all deeply racists words.

On Friday, head of the Democratic Republic of Congo national biological institute Jean-Jacques Muyembe is prepared to take part in testing of any future vaccine against the coronavirus, AFP reported.
“The vaccine will be produced in the United States, or in Canada, or in China. We’re candidates for doing the testing here,” Muyembe told a news briefing in comments that sparked controversy in DR Congo amid charges the population was being used as guinea pigs.
