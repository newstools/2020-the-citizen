Four people who insulted Police Minister Bheki Cele in a video doing the rounds on social media have been released on R1,000 bail each, following their arrest earlier this week.
IOL reports that according to police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, the four were expected to appear in court on 30 June.
In their video the group state that they refuse to stay at home and they traded insults directed at Cele. A series of photos of the lot then surfaced showing them in custody.

While the video was filmed before the country went into full lockdown, they would still have been in contravention of the then already existing state of disaster laws in place, prohibiting drinking in public after 6pm.
Police Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo previously confirmed the arrests to The Citizen, saying the group was arrested and charged for alleged transgressions of Section 11(5)(c) of the Disaster Management Act of 57 of 2020 and crimen injuria.
“On Monday the members of the Tshwane North and Temba police conducted an intelligence-led operation at Eersterust and Temba policing areas where four suspects were arrested and detained,” Naidoo previously said.
“The four suspects are Tshiamo Sandra Moroke, Lizzy Modiegi Moabelo, Mmapule Leso and Obakeng Tseremetsa Moima.
“Investigations revealed that the video was shot on 2020-03-22 at about 22:00 in the area of Stinkwater. The cellular phone that was allegedly used to either capture and/or distribute the incriminating video clip, belonging to one of the suspects … has been seized by police.”
