Enlightened Christian Gathering church leader Shepherd Bushiri is trending again following a video in which he encourages his followers to offer money to the church.
Churches have turned to live-streaming their sermons amid the coronavirus outbreak that has seen the country go into lockdown for 21 days.
In the video, Bushiri urges his followers to deposit tithes and offerings in the church account.
He says in part: “There’s a church account I’m putting on the screen right now and I want you to put your offering in your church account. Put your offering, put your seed, put your tithe. Don’t hesitate, don’t listen to the devil, don’t listen to what people say, don’t listen to what your mind says.”
