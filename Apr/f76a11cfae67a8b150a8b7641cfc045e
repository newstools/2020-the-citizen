Ford has continued its quiet introduction of new models with the latest addition being to the EcoSport range as per its new vehicle list price chart.
Introduced in November two years ago, four months after the current facelift model debuted, the entry-level Ambiente can now be had with a six-speed automatic gearbox, albeit only with the 1.5-litre petrol engine.
The same unit that powers the Figo, and known by its internal codename, Dragon, the normally aspirated three-cylinder is however retuned to produce 91 kW instead of 88 kW, with torque unchanged at 150 Nm. Although no specification details were announced, expect the standard equipment sheet to mirror that of the five-speed manual model.
As with the rest of the EcoSport range, the Ambiente auto comes standard with a four year/120 000 km warranty as well as a four year/60 000 km service plan.
