Topped by the LS as its flagship model ever since its founding 31 years ago, a new report from the United States has alleged that Lexus is mulling an ultra-luxurious SUV above the Land Cruiser-based LX.
According to Car and Driver, the newcomer will take styling inspiration from the LF-1 Limitless Concept shown at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit two years ago, and carry the LQ moniker that has allegedly already been submitted to the US Patent and Trademark Office.
Based on the publication’s claims, the LQ will ride on the same GA-L platform as the LS and have the option of three engines; the twin-turbocharged 3.5-litre badged 3.4-litre V6 from the LS 500 that produces 310kW/600Nm, the normally aspirated 3.5-litre V6 equipped with an electric motor that makes 257 kW in the LS 500h, and the all-new twin-turbo V8 slated to output 441 kW.
Like the LS, the conventional petrol engines will be mated to the ten-speed automatic gearbox, while the hybrid will get the innovative Multi Stage Hybrid ‘box that combines a CVT with a conventional torque converter four-speed automatic for an effective ten-step CVT. Anticipated to debut in 2022, the LQ is set to carry a price tag of between $80 000 (R1 503 816) to $100 000 (R1 879 770).
