Its highly awaited premiere just over three months away, a fresh report from Australia has alleged that the facelift Toyota Hilux will eclipse its arch-rival, the Ford Ranger, in both and torque when it premiers.
Spotted earlier this month undergoing testing in Thailand still wearing extensive layers of masking, the latest claim by carsguide.com.au about the bump in power is that the Hilux will target the 3.2-litre five-cylinder Ranger instead of the range-topping 2.0-litre four-cylinder bi-turbo.
According to the publication, the flagship 2.8 GD-6 engine is therefore expected to produce 150 kW as opposed to current 130 kW, but while torque is anticipated to rise 20 Nm, it remains to be seen whether Toyota will continue to offer different outputs depending on the transmission option. If so, models equipped with the standard six-speed manual ‘box will output 440 Nm and those with the six-speed automatic the same 470 Nm as the five-pot Ranger.
As has already mentioned, the exterior updates will be expanded inwards with a new Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integrated infotainment system set to feature, along with upgraded materials, possibly new safety and driver assistance systems, as well as a digital instrument cluster.
The mid-life facelift will then be capped-off with the unveiling of the GR Hilux which expected to feature the six-cylinder turbodiesel engine earmarked for the all-new Land Cruiser 300 out next year.
