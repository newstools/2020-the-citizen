Twenty-eight health workers in Gauteng have tested positive for Covid-19, the provincial health department revealed in a statement on Thursday.
“All cases are mild and did not require hospitalisation, except for one person who had to be hospitalised,” department spokesperson Kwara Kekana said.
The person was reportedly discharged from hospital on 17 April.
“The first cohort of workers, who tested positive, contracted the virus through social circles and not at work,” Kekana added, saying 11 have recovered and “some are back at work”.
The rest are currently being monitored.
“The process of disinfection continues to take place at various facilities across the province. The Gauteng Department of Health currently has sufficient PPE [personal protective equipment] and is continuously procuring and replenishing stock,” Kekana said.

Meanwhile, 46 people have been hospitalised at public and private facilities in the province.
