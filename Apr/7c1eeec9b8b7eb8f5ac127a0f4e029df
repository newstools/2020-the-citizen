Having only been speculated upon this week, the alleged Toyota Corolla Cross has been spotted undergoing testing in Thailand.
In a single image dated 23 April, the snap, uploaded by the Thai Car Inside Facebook page, shows the heavily disguised crossover bearing virtually no similarities with the model on which it will be based.
Bearing closer resemblance to the recently revealed Harrier, the depicted model could instead be the all-new Venza as indicated by the document leaked by the Allcarnews Instagram page last month, although at present, this is purely speculative.
When wraps do eventually come off next year, the C-segment SUV will slot-in above the C-HR and Yaris Cross, but likely below the RAV4. Expect clearer details to emerge in the coming weeks and months.
