The Mpumalanga department of health has announced that Driekoppies Clinic in Nkomazi has been temporarily closed.

The department stated that the decision was made to temporarily close the clinic after one of its staff members tested positive for Covid-19, reports Lowvelder.
Due to other staff members being in contact with the infected individual they all have to be quarantined. According to the department, the tracing team is currently working to trace all clinic patients who were in direct contact with the Covid-19-positive staff member.
The department stated that the clinic would be disinfected and remain closed pending the outcome of results. It has since arranged for a mobile clinic to provide healthcare services to the community for the period that the clinic will be closed.
Health MEC Sasekani Manzini said: “It is imperative that we minimise the spread of the virus at all cost. The community can access the mobile clinic at the premises of Driekoppies Clinic from tomorrow (May 21). We would like to apologise for any inconvenience that may be caused, however, the safety of our staff and community comes first.”
She said that the department was closely monitoring all positive persons and their contacts. Manzini went on to say that the community screening and testing will continue as normal to identify Covid-19 cases and further prevent the spread of the virus.
