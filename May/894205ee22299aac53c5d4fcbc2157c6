Police in Pretoria have arrested a 32-year-old Swazi national who was found in possession of a large dagga consignment.
The suspect was arrested in Atteridgeville, Pretoria, after police followed up on information that led them to an address in extension 18 in the location where large bags of dagga were found leading to the arrest.


In a separate incident, a suspect was arrested at a roadblock on the N12 after he was found in possession of 111 sheep suspected to have been stolen.
The roadblock was to ensure that motorists adhere to the Covid-19 lockdown regulations.
The suspect reportedly alleged that he was from the Northern Cape and was travelling to Springs, Gauteng.


The police in the Gauteng province have been conducting operation Okae Molao between Wednesday and Thursday, which resulted in a number of successes.
Gauteng community safety MEC Faith Mazibuko said these successes included 58 arrests in connection with gender-based violence incidents.
