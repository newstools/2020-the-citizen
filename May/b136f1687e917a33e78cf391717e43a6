WesBank says claims on social media that it is planning to repossess 45,000 vehicles are “untrue and unfounded.”
“Our priority is to assist our customers impacted by Covid-19 where possible – please apply for payment relief or make payment arrangements,” said the bank on Monday.
Sizwe Dhlomo left social media users in a state of shock on Monday morning after asking if the bank was planning to repossess 45,000 vehicles amid the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown that has left South Africans struggling to keep up with payments.

Bruh, 45 000 cars. The thing is, what are they going to do with them? They must just leave them & hope the clients catch up. https://t.co/agD6iMT4gz

While most expressed fear that their vehicles may be repossessed, some, however, concluded he may have been throwing shade at AKA because he no longer has his BMWi8.
“Kudala yahamba ke leyo [It has been gone for a long time]. It wasn’t his to begin with,” claimed Dhlomo.
The two were at each other’s throats following Dhlomo’s tweets in which he called AKA a bad businessman following his claim that Reebok did not pay him for his personalised sneakers.

AKA responded to Dhlomo’s tweets at the weekend and dragged him for “wearing bootleg cut jeans and riding tractors”.

The two trended on social media, with Dhlomo threatening to “f**k” AKA up for free.

I’ll be very direct with you son, mina I’ll f**k you up for free, no need to sign contracts. Then I’ll front you money for legal fees after that. https://t.co/OBhmrd2eZy
