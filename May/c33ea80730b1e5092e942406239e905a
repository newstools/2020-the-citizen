Thirteen suspects arrested for allegedly burning the house of a woman they accused of practising witchcraft appeared before the Senwabarwana Magistrate’s Court on Thursday.
The accused, all aged between 18 and 32, were denied bail and their cases of arson were postponed to 21 May for a formal bail application and further police investigations, police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said.
“One of the suspects was found to be a 15-year-old minor and has since been released into the custody of his parents,” Mojapelo said.
He said the suspects were Michael Dolo (31), Allie Matee Kgomo (29), Nthongwa Almoria Makhura (31), Mokgadi Rivonia Mehale (29), Nthabiseng Civilization Mmofsa (29), Lerato Morudu (29), Lefty Morudu (22), Matome Kenneth Morudu (23), Teresa Morudu(18), Matena Ngoepe (24), Malose Joseph Phooko (23) and Emmanuel Chuene Ratlou (29).
“Their arrest follows an incident where the house belonging to a 63-year-old woman was on Monday, 11 May 2020, set alight by a group of community members after they accused her of practising witchcraft and being responsible for the disappearance of a 14-year-old girl from the same village.
“Morongwa Marakalala reportedly went missing on 5 May at about 9pm. She was allegedly last seen with someone whom it’s believed to be her boyfriend and has since disappeared.”
