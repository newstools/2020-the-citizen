According to Pinetown Cluster communications officer, Capt Bongumusa Manqele, reports indicate that people were angry when they were told that the department of labour offices would not be opening until they got a go-ahead from the head office.

It is reported that the crowds are still at the scene waiting for an official from the department of labour to update them.
Blue Security community liaison officer, Andreas Mathios, who is at the scene, said vehicles were stoned and the road has been completely blocked off.
“SAPS are also at the scene monitoring the situation,” added Mathios.
