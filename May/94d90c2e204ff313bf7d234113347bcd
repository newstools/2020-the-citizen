Toyota South Africa has officially ruled out the possibility of bringing a new unibody SUV to market that will sit above the RAV4.
In response to a question by The Citizen Motoring as to whether the recent introductions of the Harrier in Japan and the Highlander in Europe would result in one or the other being considered for the local market as an alternative to the Fortuner, the automaker stated that no such plans are in place as the Hilux-based seven-seater rates as a better fit for “local market requirements”, with local production at the Prospecton Plant in Durban also counting in its favour.
At the same time, it also remained largely mum as to whether the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza-based Urban Cruiser would be considered as its new entry-level SUV below the C-HR, merely saying that, “the important thing is that the product should fit with the local line-up and not cannabalise one of our own products”.
It also didn’t want to be drawn into speculation as to whether the incoming Land Cruiser 300 could continue with the current 4.5 D-4D turbodiesel V8 engine for the local market only in place of the reported six-cylinder powerunits, citing the newcomer’s yet to be confirmed specifications and it being “under study” as the main reasons.
