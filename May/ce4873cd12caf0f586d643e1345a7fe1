Volkswagen has reportedly stopped delivers of the all-new Golf due to suspected software issues thought to have been sorted out.
According to a weekend report by German newspaper, Der Spiegel, the cause for concern centres around the emergency calling system which was found to have contain a number of glitches and therefore unlikely to work when used to report an accident.
A type of system that become mandatory on all cars sold in Europe from 2018, the latest software problem comes on the back of Volkswagen cancelling the Golf’s initial unveiling at the Frankfurt Motor Show last year due to a raft of software problems relating to the online over-the-air updates.
“Due to their online connectivity there is a lot more software especially in the area of security, which is a real challenge since the car is no longer a closed ecosystem,” Volkswagen Head of Sales, Marketing and Aftersales, Jürgen Stackmann, was quoted by Automotive News Europe as saying at the time.
While it remains unknown as to how many models have been effected since production started at the end of last year, Der Spiegel reports that a recall is being planned in order for the problem to be sorted out. Production will however continue.
As it stands, with Volkswagen only expected to bring the newcomer to South Africa later this year, chances are that the various issues will have been rectified before sales commence.
