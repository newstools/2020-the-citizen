Due to begin in Australia in October, the T20 competition’s start is looking increasingly unlikely amid virus-related travel restrictions.
“If that opens up a window I think the IPL would be a great fit,” Cummins told media in Sydney.
He remained optimistic that the World Cup and Australian tour of England would go ahead, but if those were cancelled at least a return of T20 could be a boost to the game.
“You have millions and millions of people watching that tournament around the world… potentially even more after a long break off cricket,” he said.
“There’s a lot of reasons why I would want it to go ahead but the main one is it’s a great tournament.”
The coronavirus forced the money-spinning IPL to postpone its March 29 start date and organisers were already reportedly eyeing a return around October.
Cummins said he was eager to return to play after nearly a ten-week break from the sport.
“I’m just about ready to get back into it and ready for that next tour,” he said.
A decision on whether to postpone the World Cup could come from Thursday’s ICC board meeting over concerns of flying 16 teams into Australia during the crisis.
