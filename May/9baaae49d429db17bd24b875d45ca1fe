The South African Police Service (SAPS) has said that a social media post alleging that its members confiscated 200 food parcels that a church in Pretoria wanted to distribute at a Bonaccord squatter close to the city is “false and malicious”.
The police said the church had no knowledge of the incident and that the claims had been investigated and were found to be “baseless, false and malicious”.
