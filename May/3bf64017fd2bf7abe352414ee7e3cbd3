South Africans have taken to social media to mock President Cyril Ramaphosa’s no-kissing rule.
In his address to the nation on Wednesday evening, Ramaphosa said that as some areas entered level 3 lockdown restrictions, people should practise social distancing.
“Kissing will be a thing of the past,” he said, much to the amusement of South Africans, who have taken to social media to comment on the rule.
Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema asked: “What if Minister Dlamini Zuma says we must hug and kiss tomorrow?”


This after, in an earlier address, Ramaphosa announced cigarettes would be sold under level 4, only for Dlamini-Zuma to announce a continued ban following consultations with the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC).
These were some of the reactions on social media:
