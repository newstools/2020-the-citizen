He is understood to have died from complications related to the illness.
Those who worked with him have paid tribute to his work ethic and great sense of humour.
eMedia Investments said in a statement it was saddened by loss of its camera operator, who worked at eNCA at the company’s Cape Town office.
He was tested and admitted to intensive care. Lungile’s test results confirmed that he had Covid-19, and he passed away in hospital on Wednesday morning, they said.
eMedia chief operating officer Antonio Lee said Lungile joined eNCA in December 2013 as an ENG camera operator. Before that, he had worked at CNBC Africa.
“Lungile was known for his larger-than-life personality and his dedication to his craft. His buoyant laughter will be sorely missed. Our thoughts are with his wife, Nandipha, and his children,” Lee said.
“In adherence to government regulations, we have disinfected and closed the affected floor,” Lee said, and they had instituted a tracing and tracking process.
Employees who had contact with Lungile were advised to stay at home. They would be tested and go into self-isolation.
The company was making plans to honour Lungile’s memory.
Many journalists have found themselves at the coalface of reporting on the pandemic, with the media industry designated an essential service since the start of lockdown.
