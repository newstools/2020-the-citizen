Gauteng health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku explained why the province had decided not to release confirmed Covid-19 cases for specific communities in the province, EWN reported.
Masuku said if the cases were made public, it would increase stigma and discrimination, especially in townships.
The health department launched testing and screening sites across the province targeting mostly township areas.
On Friday, Masuku and Premier David Makhura visited one of the sites in Diepsloot after a nurse tested positive for the virus.
Health officials have so far screened more than 12,000 people and tested just over 1,000 since April.
During an inspection in the area, Masuku was asked why the numbers couldn’t be made public as per the area.
“What we have seen is that it increases stigma, it increases discrimination and increases prejudice. I’m not saying there won’t come a time where we have to, but we are cautiously utilising the information as public health officials so we can plan and have an effective response,” Masuku said.
A nurse who tested positive for the virus was in isolation and recovering well and her coworkers had since tested negative.
Meanwhile, Makhura said he was impressed with the conduct of many residents, saying they were now beginning to be aware of the dangers of Covid-19.
Masuku also noted the growing demand for more screening stations countrywide and said government would ensure there were testing and screening stations at shopping malls.
Gauteng has 1,952 confirmed Covid-19 cases with 22 deaths as of Monday morning, while there have been 1,247 recoveries in the process.
