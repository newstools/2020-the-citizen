Member of the mayoral committee for community development Councillor Margaret Arnolds, handed over a sanitising booth at the Eldorado Park Clinic and launched a toll-free line in an effort to prevent and slow down the spread of Covid-19.
South Africa moved to Level 4 of the lockdown at the beginning of May 2020.
Arnolds said they were aware that this month marked the beginning of winter, and local clinics would be the first point of call for residents as a result of flu symptoms.
It is for this reason that MMC Arnolds has secured partnerships with key role players. The best way to prevent and slow the spread is for residents to be well-informed about the Covid-19 virus and have reliable 24-hour access to information on the virus.
MMC Arnolds thanked ASI Financial Services for the toll-free service and Valumin (Pty) for donating the Mobile Sanitation Tunnels.
