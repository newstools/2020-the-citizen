As the future of the capital city remains in limbo, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has filed papers calling for the immediate implementation of a Pretoria High Court order which declared the dissolution of the Tshwane council unlawful.
The party on Thursday filed papers for a section 18 application at the High Court in Pretoria despite appeals from both the ANC and the EFF who intend to take their fight to oppose the DA over Tshwane to the Constitutional Court.
In late April, Judge Dunstan Mlambo set aside Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) MEC Lebogang Maile and the Gauteng provincial government’s decision from March 4 to place the Tshwane metro under administration.
Afterwards, the ANC and EFF launched applications appealing Mlambo’s ruling.
Labelling the ruling confusing, Maile said the Gauteng provincial government would appeal it as they needed more clarity.
The matter will now be taken to the Constitutional Court, as “we are still of the firm view that the reasons … to dissolve the Tshwane municipal council are very solid, with merit, as contained in the dissolution notice”, Maile said.
On Thursday, Maile slammed the previous DA-led administration for allegedly plunging the metro into questionable, costly legal disputes by not adhering to proper supply chain management processes.
The Cogta MEC spearheaded the announcement of 10 administrators who were appointed to take charge of Tshwane after it was placed under administration.
The DA wants the court to immediately enforce its judgment on the council.
