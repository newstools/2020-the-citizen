Pick n Pay has temporarily closed its Musgrave Centre branch in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, following the death of one of its employees on Thursday.
However, the retailer made it clear that the employee did not die of Covid-19 and that the closure was merely a precaution.
“While there is no suggestion at this stage that his sad passing was linked to Covid-19, we are, as a precaution, deep cleaning and sanitising the entire store,” Pick n Pay said in a statement.
The retailer added that the store would be opened for business again on Friday.
“We have also initiated our protocol and will trace his close contacts to self-quarantine until we have more clarity,” Pick n Pay said.

“She has subsequently tested positive for coronavirus.”
The company moved swiftly to trace her close contacts and asked them to self-isolate.
