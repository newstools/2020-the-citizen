This comes after a Facebook page impersonating Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung updated that Amakhosi are likely to be crowned champions during the meeting.
“Please note that the Football Manager Bobby Motaung is not on any social media platform,” read a statement from the Chiefs.
“There are fake accounts out there impersonating him. He is distancing himself from them as they do not represent him or the club.”
The PSL executive is set for a meeting on Thursday to determine whether or not to finish the 2019/20 season, which has been suspended since March due to the coronavirus outbreak.
