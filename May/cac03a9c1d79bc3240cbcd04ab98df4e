Having pulled the CT from certain markets as early as 2017, Lexus is reportedly considering a spiritual successor, but in the shape of an SUV based on parent company Toyota’s new Yaris Cross.
According to China’s Auto Home, the newcomer could be called BX, a decision likely to be frown upon by Citroën, and aside from featuring Lexus’s corporate Spindle Grille and redesigned interior, will otherwise be identical to its sibling underneath. That means not only the retention of the GA-B platform, but also the 85 kW 1.5-litre hybrid engine combined with a CVT. As ever, a sportier F Sport derivative will be added fitted with bespoke interior and exterior trim, as well as four-wheel-drive, whereas the standard model will be front-wheel-drive only.
Set to be positioned below the RAV4-based UX as Lexus’ new entry-level SUV/crossover, the BX is only expected to premiere in 2023, but until then, don’t be surprised when spy shots of pre-production prototypes undergoing testing are leaked online or on social media within the coming months.
