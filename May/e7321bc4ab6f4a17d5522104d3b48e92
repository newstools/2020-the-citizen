Virus spreading faster

“As the president and Professor Salim Abdool Karim have indicated, the virus cannot be stopped, and the hard lockdown only bought us time to prepare for the peak,” Winde said.
Presidential visit
As South Africa gears for the Covid-19 peak, President Cyril Ramaphosa is set to visit the province on Friday to assess preparedness.
“We look forward to showcasing our plans and response strategy with the president.
“Yesterday (Saturday), our top public health experts shared our plans with (Health) Minister Zweli Mkhize. He indicated he was pleased and satisfied with what was presented,” Winde said.
