A specialist doctor at Netcare Ferncrest Hospital in Rustenburg in the North West province is under self-quarantine and precautionary suspension after a patient in his care, who later died from Covid-19-related complications, exposed nurses, other patients and staff to the virus.
According to a Newzroom Afrika report, the patient had recently undergone surgery when the doctor made the decision to place him in a recovery ward with lower personal protective equipment (PPE) standards than other wards.
Whether or not the doctor knew about the patient’s Covid-19 status is unclear at this stage.
Prior to his death, the patient infected two nurses at the hospital who were responsible for treating him after his surgery.
Contact tracing has been done and those who had been in direct contact with the infected nurses are said to be under self-quarantine.
An estimated four patients, 16 nurses and 19 cleaners were exposed to the virus while the patient was in the recovery ward.
