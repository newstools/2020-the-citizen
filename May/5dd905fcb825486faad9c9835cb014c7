Mosimane signed a new four-year contract with the Pretoria-based club after months of speculation about his future with the defending Absa Premiership champions.
The African coach of the year had attracted interest from several clubs in the continent but said he would only accept after offer if he couldn’t reach an agreement with Sundowns.
“I’m honoured and humbled to be given another opportunity to lead Mamelodi Sundowns,” said Mosimane.
“One of the main reasons for me to renew my contract with Mamelodi Sundowns is the president’s trust and faith in me, he trusted me to lead this team to where it is – and fulfil his wish to build a team to conquer Africa. It’s humbling to be part of a brand like Sundowns and contribute to its success, especially as a local coach and also having played for the team.”
