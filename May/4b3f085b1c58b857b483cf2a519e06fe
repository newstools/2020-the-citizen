The Zimbabwean forward was loaned out to KAS Eupen by Anderlecht this season in search of game time after falling down the pecking order at his mother club.
Sundowns previously showed interest in the Bafana Bafana striker before he decided to join City from Portuguese side Vitoria Setubal in January 2019.
Now a source has told Phakaaathi that the Brazilians are keen to sign the 29-year-old if Musona snubs them again and remains in Belgium.
“Pitso (Mosimane) likes Erasmus and he believes that he can play the role that he had earmarked for Musona should the Zimbabwean attacker decides to stay in Europe. Pitso has never hidden his admiration for Erasmus and was not happy that Sundowns lost out on him when he joined City last year. If City are willing to sell, then Sundowns will definitely go for his services,” said the source.
With Erasmus contracted to City until June 2022, Sundowns will no doubt have to pay big to get the Bafana star, but the Brazilians have never been scared to pay big money to get their target in the past.
