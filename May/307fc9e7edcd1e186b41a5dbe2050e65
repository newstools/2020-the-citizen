After a run of only three years, Volkswagen has reportedly started withdrawing the Polo GTI from several markets in Europe due to the controversial Euro 7 emissions regulations.
While only expected to be enforced next year in readiness for the full implementation in 2026, motor1.com Brazil reports that Wolfsburg had taken the decision early to axe the GTI in key markets such as France, the United Kingdom and even in Germany as its emitting of 159 g/km will impact on the 95 g/km fleet average set-out by the regulations.
As present, it remains to be seen whether the move can be rectified at a later stage, but while likely to pose little threat to the South African assembled GTI, it could have future model repercussions such as a possible switch towards electrification as either a hybrid or full electric model going forward.
