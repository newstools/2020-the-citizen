Kaonga, however, may be forced to wait longer before joining the club, should Chiefs’ ban to sign players for two transfer windows continue to stand.

Chiefs were banned by Fifa from signing any new players in the next two transfer windows after they were found guilty of illegally signing Madagascan Andriamirado “Dax” Andrianarimanana in 2018.
Amakhosi have since appealed the ban at the Court of Abritriation for Sport and are waiting for CAS to make a ruling on the matter.
“Look, the representative from Chiefs came to me one day and said they like the boy… he’s got the potential and they will look at him,” Aphane told The Sowetan.
“The boy has just arrived in January here in South Africa, he has played few games. They are still going to look at how he is doing but I can tell you that he is a better player to watch.”



Aphane added that he is not in a hurry to sell the player even if Chiefs don’t win their appeal.
“There are also AmaZulu who have shown interest. This thing (Chiefs transfer ban) is only for two window periods, so it is now in June and in January. For a player who has just arrived in South Africa and showing potential, it will be good for him to play more of the games in the GladAfrica Championship so he can be ready to go to Premiership.
“Most of the foreigners, when they come to South Africa, they go straight to Premiership and they struggle, so it is much better if the player starts in lower divisions. He is 24 years old now.”
