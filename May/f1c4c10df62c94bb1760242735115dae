A female nurse at the Springbok pharmacy in Alberton testing positive has led to the store temporarily closing its doors on Friday.
MMC for community safety Frans Mmoko and officials from the department of health met with the management of Springbok Pharmacy in Alberton to discuss reports of a positive case of Covid-19.
Mmoko briefed media that there was a positive case of coronavirus reported among the staff of the pharmacy and that the person has been quarantined.
He went on to explain that they have discussed the way forward with the pharmacy to ensure the safety of the staff and customers of the store.
Mmoko was concerned at the store’s response to the case alleging the store had not followed the necessary health protocols, to the latter.
“As a result, management was urged to shut down immediately.
“We immediately advised the management to shut down temporarily so that all their staff, especially those who were in immediate contact with the person who tested positive, to be subjected to intense testing.
“It is very disappointing, these issues were never shared with the authorities. How disappointing it is for people to treat the situation as normal when you have a positive test.”
