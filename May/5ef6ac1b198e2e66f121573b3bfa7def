A success in both India and parts of Latin America, Honda has officially confirmed that it will be bringing the tiny Jazz-based WR-V to South Africa during the fourth quarter of this year.
On sale since 2016 before becoming available in right-hand-drive a year later, the WR-V, its name standing for Winsome Runabout Vehicle, is built at Honda’s Tapukara Plant in the state of Rajasthan and measures 3 999 mm in overall length with a wheelbase of 2 555 mm, height of 1 601 mm and width of 1 734 mm.
Set to slot-in below the HR-V, the five-seat WR-V, which recently underwent a mid-life revision in order to comply with BS6 emissions regulations, will more than likely forego the 66kW/110Nm normally aspirated 1.2-litre petrol engine for the 88kW/145Nm 1.5-litre offered in the BR-V, but despite being the most popular option in India, the 74kW/200Nm 1.5 i-DTEC turbodiesel engine is not expected to come to South Africa. Transmissions will likely consist out of a six-speed manual or a CVT.
In India, a choice of four trim levels are offered; Edge, S, VX and Exclusive with pricing from Rs 808 000 (R199 451) to Rs 935 000 (R230 800). Expect local price and spec to be announced closer to the model’s market debut.

As well as the WR-V, the all-new City will return to South Africa as the Ballade, but only next year after making its world premiere in Thailand six months ago. While not anticipated to differ radically inside and out from the Indian-sourced model that will go on sale later this year, the Ballade is however not forecasted to come with the new 1.0-litre turbocharged engine offered in Thailand. Instead, it will use the new 1.5-litre petrol engine slated for its Indian sibling that pumps-out 90kW/155Nm.
As for SUVs, buyers holding out for a new flagship model above the CR-V will be disappointed to learn that no plans are in place for such a model, officially ruling out vehicles such as the Chinese market Avancier and the North American Passport and Pilot.
