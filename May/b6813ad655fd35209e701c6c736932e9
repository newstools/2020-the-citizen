It has been one of the most highly publicised transfer dramas in recent South African rugby history, but the Pieter-Steph du Toit saga is nearing its end.
The future of the 2019 World Rugby Player of the Year has been up in the air since he exited his contract with Western Province and the Stormers last week.
Du Toit had taken advantage of a three-week window that allowed professional players in South Africa to exit their contracts immediately as part of a broader cost-cutting mission from SA Rugby. With pay cuts being implemented across the board, the contract window was allocated to allow players an opportunity to seek other more lucrative and stable employment as the fight against the global coronavirus crisis continued.
Du Toit was understood to have received a mega offer from France, while there had also been reported interest from Japan, but his situation was complicated by the fact that he exited his contract at the Stormers with the intention of signing a new one.
Since Friday last week, Stormers management had been trying to settle on a new agreement with Du Toit but, as of Tuesday morning, nothing had been confirmed.
It was understood, though, that those negotiations were reaching their end and while one source described the situation as ’50/50′ on Monday, a final outcome was expected sooner rather than later.
The Stormers declined to comment officially on the progress, saying that they would communicate the outcome once there had been official confirmation.
