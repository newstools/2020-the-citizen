BMW’s successor to the discontinued i8 has allegedly been cancelled before its intended debut in 2023.
Widely believed to have been previewed by the Vision M NEXT concept shown at BMW’s NextGen conference last year, the supposed 441 kW newcomer, according to a report by the BMW Blog, has had its development uprooted not only by the Coronavirus pandemic, but also costs.
Citing Germany’s Manager-Magazin, the online forum claims that the project had been placed on the backburner for quite some time, despite no official confirmation yet, as the development costs, a projected price tag of $160 000 (R2 942 320) according to Car and Driver, and volume simply made no financial sense for Munich to commence production.
As mentioned, the global impact of COVID-19, which has resulted in the closure of a number of factories and implemented lockdowns, has also been fingered as an attributing factor with the loss in revenue making the potential huge investment financially impossible.
