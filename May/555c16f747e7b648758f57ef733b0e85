Nzuza was last in the news in April when he released a written apology to EFF leader Julius Malema for in 2018 having accused the EFF leader of corruption during his time as the president of the ANC Youth League, where Nzuza is the secretary-general.


I hope he/she is otherwise physically okay. No matter how much we complain about these politicians, we don't wish for harm. We are human.
