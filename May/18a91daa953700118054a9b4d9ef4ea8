If there is one symbol of the culture of conspicuous consumption – which has led to prosperity for some, but has negatively affected parts of society and the planet itself – then it must be the suburban shopping mall.

So, we think it is interesting that the number of “zombie” shopping malls across the US is on the increase. Many of these were already declining through loss of tenants, but the process has been accelerated because of the coronavirus crisis.
The economic catastrophe brought about by government regulations aimed at slowing down the spread of the virus, has meant many mall shops have either gone bankrupt or are unable to afford the rent … and malls are largely empty.
