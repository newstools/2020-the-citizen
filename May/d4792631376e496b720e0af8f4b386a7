Due to lockdown regulations and the economic situation in South Africa, Gautrain will not increase its fares in June, as would normally have been the case.
In accordance with the Gautrain Concession Agreement, Gautrain fares are adjusted annually in June, guided by the Consumer Price Index.
The Gautrain Management Agency and Bombela Concession Company have decided not to increase fares in June, but to instead delay this increase to later in the year once it has more accurate information of when lockdown regulations will be lifted, reports Kempton Express.
Gautrain resumed a reduced service on 4 May after the system was closed during Level 5 of the lockdown.
