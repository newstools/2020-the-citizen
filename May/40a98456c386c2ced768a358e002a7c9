Student and model Bianca Schoombee garnered all the wrong attention literally overnight on Tuesday after an unknown Twitter user took a deep dive into the Miss South Africa hopeful’s Twitter feed.
The 21-year-old first won everyone over when she posted her virtual Miss SA entry on Twitter on Saturday explaining why she believes she should take over from Sasha Lee Laurel.

However, her newfound fame turned to notoriety when a tweet commenting on someone’s skin colour was unearthed. This turned the spotlight on more of her tweets.
Schoombee, like many other hopefuls, had to post her entry video to social media as part of the current format of the competition.
In addition to having to post their introduction video on social media using the hashtag #MissSA2020 and tagging @Official Miss South Africa in their posts, entrants had to give the judging panel and organisation consent to do any and all necessary background checks.
Upon submitting entries, hopefuls also agree to adhere to the organisations’ media and communications policy which has not been made publicly available.

Because her tweets trended in the late hours of Tuesday evening and the early hours of Monday morning, Schoombee has yet to respond but that did not stop Twitter users from theorising that an apology was coming while many joked about what form it will take.

Bianca was posting those offensive jokes teens tell. The kind of jokes that truly offended you once you left high school because you realized that they were racist ????

Prediction for how tomorrow plays out:
– At some point Bianca will trend– She will issue an apology (maybe cry?)– A debate will rage on the TL about pulling up old tweets
