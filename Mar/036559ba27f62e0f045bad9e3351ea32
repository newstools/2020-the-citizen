James Mayinga, who is now a SuperSport TV analyst, had his accounts hacked this week, and then the filthy posts started pouring out.
“Please note that my accounts have been hacked and I didn’t post all the things about porn,” Mayinga wrote on his WhatsApp status this week. He then posted screengrabs of posts purporting to be from him, with one a newspaper cover where he supposedly bares his soul (and a whole lot more) in a lead story.
Mayinga said he didn’t know who was behind the hacking of his accounts but had reported the matter as he was worried it could ruin his good reputation.
