Over the last few weeks, students have been up in arms over a number of issues, including a lack of accommodation, historical debt and the extension of registration periods.
The South African reports that it is believed that this all began when returning students were told, in recent months, that those with historical debt had to pay at least 15% of the total amount to qualify for registration for the coming academic year. This group has been on a rampage ever since in an effort to disrupt academic proceedings until their demands are heard.
The university later approached the Durban High Court in February to obtain an interdict prohibiting all students from protesting, inciting protests, damaging property or assaulting anyone.
The interdict has done little to quell unrest, however.
