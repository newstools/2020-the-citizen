Update: The university cancelled one class only – the rest of the faculty’s classes have continued as usual. 
The University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) Covid-19 management committee has cancelled a student’s activities at the Faculty of Health Sciences, they said in a statement on Friday morning.
This after the quarantining of a medical student who came into contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus.
“The student is being monitored closely and has not displayed any symptoms of Covid-19,” the statement explained.

The student’s clinical activities were cancelled as a precautionary measure while the student awaited test results, expected to be received later on Friday.
Meanwhile, South Africans being repatriated from Wuhan are expected to arrive at Protea Hotel’s Ranch Resort in Limpopo on Friday.
The resort is under lockdown with a strong police presence after threats of disruptions were received.
Resort staff have been assured that they would continue to get their full salaries for the duration of the repatriated citizens’ quarantine period, plus an additional R100 per day.
