The 32-year-old international had been in isolation along with the rest of Serie A leaders’ squad following teammate Daniele Rugani’s positive test a week ago, with France’s Blaise Matuidi also catching the virus in recent days.
Higuain had reportedly asked Juve for permission to visit his sick mother and had a test confirming he was negative for COVID-19.
The recommended quarantine period is two weeks.

Germany’s Sami Khedira and Bosnian Miralem Pjanic have also left Turin to join their families, Gazzetto reported.
