Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba has called on Limpopo residents who are based in Gauteng to heed calls to stay in the province in an attempt to prevent the spread of the coronavirus to rural areas.
The Easter holiday is a time when most Limpopo residents who are based in Gauteng drive home to be with their families.
Currently, Gauteng accounts for most cases of coronavirus in the country, with 125 confirmed cases, followed by the Western Cape with 74 cases and KwaZulu-Natal with 27 cases.
Limpopo has one case, while the Free State and Mpumalanga confirmed seven and five cases respectively.
Responding to a suggestion by a concerned citizen, who asked for a Gauteng lockdown to prevent a rapid spread of the coronavirus, Ramathuba said it would be difficult to contain once it reached the rural areas in the province.
“We call on all Limpopo citizens based in Gauteng and other provinces to heed this progressive call. Once the virus reaches our villages, it will be difficult to contain.#OurHealthOurResponsibility #Covid19InSA.”
While this is not an official ban on travel outside Gauteng, the MEC was only suggesting ways that could keep communities safe from the coronavirus.
