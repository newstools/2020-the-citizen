Nelson Mandela’s grandson, Ndaba, has revealed that he has tested positive for the coronavirus.
In a video, Ndaba said he had tested positive for “the rona,” a street term which some have given to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
“What now, that I have the rona?”
He is not showing any symptoms and has admitted that he would go on a healthier diet, which included no alcohol.

Ndaba posted a second video on Instagram where he reiterated that he was not taking the situation lightly.
Thanking his close friends for support, Ndaba said: “I’m posting this video now because there are some people that feel I wasn’t serious in my last post.
“This is a very serious situation, and I don’t take it lightly for a second. However, when you’ve gone through so much in life, I know, for example, that stressing is not going to make a difference. So, I urge you not to stress. I urge you not to get anxiety.”
