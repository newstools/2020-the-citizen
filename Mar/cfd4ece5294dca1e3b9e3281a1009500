In Cape Town on Sunday afternoon, a fire broke out on Tafelberg Road on the lower slopes of Table Mountain, prompting the city’s firefighting crews to rush to the scene.
Dark smoke was visible from the city and according to eyewitnesses, the wind drove the fire towards Lion’s Head.
City of Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services are monitoring the slopes of Table Mountain after the blaze began.
“We currently have 19 firefighting appliances on scene, with seasonal firefighters also in attendance. [There are] also reports of four dwellings that have caught alight in Trek Road.”
In a statement, the City said the fire was moving and was burning on the Signal Hill side by the afternoon.
“The City’s Disaster Risk Management Centre is closely monitoring the fire. At this stage, there is no cause to evacuate”
South African National Parks said NCC Wildfires, Volunteer Wildfire Services and Working on Fire ground and aerial crews collaborated to contain the blaze, which was first spotted around 1pm.
This is the second fire in the area in a month, after the previous blaze forced the Table Mountain cableway to close temporarily.
Residents were urged to close all windows and doors to prevent draft and reduce heat.
Members of the public were also advised to try to reduce their exposure to the smoke from the fire.
Wildfire smoke irritates your eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Children, pregnant women, people with asthma and heart disease needed to be especially careful, the City said.
