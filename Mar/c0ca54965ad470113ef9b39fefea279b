The subject of much speculation about its prowess having been put through its paces in Namibia over recent weeks, Land Rover has opened order books for the all-new Defender, thus revealing pricing for one of the most eagerly awaited new entrants of the year.

Fresh from its world debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September last year, the Defender line-up will commence with the long wheelbase 110 set to be launched officially in June, followed by the short wheelbase 90 near the end of the year.

With online configurations, according to Land Rover, standing at 12 000 customised units, the 30 model line-up, fifteen apiece for the 90 and 110, comprises six trim levels; base, S, SE, HSE, the limited-run First Edition and flagship X with a choice of four accessory packs being offered; Urban, Country, Explorer and Adventure.

Up front, the Defender will be motivated by a choice of three powerunits; the D240 whose 2.0-litre Ingenium turbodiesel punches out 177kW/430Nm and the P300 which uses a similarly sized albeit petrol Ingenium four-pot that produces 221kW/400Nm
At the sharp-end is the P400 MHEV that combines a 3.0-litre supercharged Ingenium straight-six petrol with a 48-volt mild hybrid system for a total output of 294kW/550Nm. Regardless of the engine however, all three are mated as standard to a ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic gearbox.
