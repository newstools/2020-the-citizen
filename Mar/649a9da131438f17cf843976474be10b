South Africa’s sovereign credit rating has been downgraded to subinvestment grade, or junk status, by Moody’s – the last ratings agency to do so.
Fitch and S&P downgraded SA to junk in 2017 already.
Moody’s cited in a statement the deterioration in SA’s fiscal strength and “structurally very weak growth” as reasons for lowering the rating to Ba1 from Baa3. The outlook remains negative, News24 reported.
This is a developing story.
