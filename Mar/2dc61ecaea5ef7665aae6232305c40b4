Eskom announced on Wednesday at noon that load shedding will remain at stage 4 until further notice following a breakdown at the Koeberg nuclear power station.
The Koeberg unit will only be back in service by the weekend at the earliest. However, a number of other units are being returned to service, meaning that the load shedding situation is unlikely to worsen just yet.

Eskom has urged customers to use electricity sparingly by setting air-conditioners’ average temperature at 23°C, switching off geysers over peak periods and using the cold water tap rather than using the geyser every time.
“Set your swimming pool pump cycle to run twice a day, three hours at a time. At the end of the day, turn off computers, copiers, printers and fax machines at the switch.
“Eskom also wishes to remind South Africans that there is a possibility of load shedding over the next 18 months, as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health.”
