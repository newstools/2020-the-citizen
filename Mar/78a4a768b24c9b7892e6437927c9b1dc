Government has published numbers to call during the 21 days of the country’s lockdown.
President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a total lockdown of the country for 21 days from midnight on Thursday that would see all businesses, including all restaurants, cafes, bars and coffee shops, not operating as they have not been deemed essential services.
People will be able to leave their homes to buy food and medicine, as well as other essentials.
“Essential and critical business continuity services will need to remain open to support the health sector and to keep our people healthy, safe, and secure under these extraordinary conditions. We ask all businesses and people to take this seriously and to help us respond as effectively as possible to contain and minimise the impact of Covid-19,” reads a statement from the presidency.
Call centres providing life and health; energy, food and water supply, social, transactional, communications, law and order and international critical business continuity services will also remain operational.
