It was reminiscent of the deputy health minister of Iran who made headlines for first denying that the novel coronavirus was in his country, only to have to later admit that he had contracted it.
He had also appeared on live TV coughing and sneezing.

Footage of the cough starting circulating shortly afterwards.
