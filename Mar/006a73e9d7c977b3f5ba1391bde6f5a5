German nationals stuck in South Africa because of the lockdown on travelling will be repatriated on Tuesday, after the German government intervened.
Speaking at an inter-ministerial media briefing on Friday, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said the evacuation would take place on Tuesday.
Earlier on Friday, it was reported that a group of 60 German tourists had been placed in quarantine after one tested positive for Covid-19.
The group – described as being uncooperative – had planned to leave the country on Thursday.
In a statement on Friday, before Mbalula’s address, the German Embassy said it was working on a solution to get German tourists in South Africa back home but nothing had been confirmed yet.
