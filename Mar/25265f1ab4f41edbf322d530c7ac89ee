Two hijackers were injured after being involved in a shootout with police in Verulam, KwaZulu-Natal on Friday night. 
Arrive Alive reports that the suspects hijacked a white Toyota Hilux bakkie from Cato Manor, which had a tracking device installed. After the bakkie’s tracking device was activated, and indicated the vehicle was travelling towards Verulam, Tracker contacted Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) for further assistance to chase the suspects. 
SAPS were also in pursuit of the suspects, finding the bakkie’s signal and pursuing it onto the R102 highway. 
During the chase, suspects opened fire on police, who retaliated. The hijackers lost control of the bakkie and crashed into a median at an intersection in Verulam. They then attempted to flee on foot, while still shooting at police.
