Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) has released the Census of Commercial Agriculture (CoCA) 2017 report after the last census was conducted for 2007.
Stats SA’s statistician-general, Risenga Maluleke, released the results of the CoCA 2017 at a media briefing held on Tuesday in Pretoria.
The agricultural census covers commercial farmers, which are farms registered for tax, and it was conducted from 15 October 2018 until June 2019.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) recommends that a country conducts a census of agriculture at least once every ten years.
Farming enterprises were being contacted via telephone and given an option of completing the questionnaire through e-mail or a visit by a Stats SA official where the data will be collected via computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI) using tablets.
Here are the statistics below:
Number of farms
The report shows that the total number of farms/farming units involved in the commercial agriculture industry in 2017 was 40,122. The largest proportion of farms was in livestock farming (13,639 or 33.9% of the total), followed by mixed farming (12,458 or 31.1%) and field crops (8,559 or 21.3%).

In terms of area planted, the major field crops in both 2007 and 2017 were maize, soya beans, sunflower seeds, wheat and sugarcane. Between 2007 and 2017, the area planted increased in three cases, namely maize, soya beans and sunflower seeds.
All major field crops were mostly planted under dry land, i.e. their main source of water was rain. In 2017, sunflower seeds had the highest proportion (99.2% of sunflower seeds) planted under dry land, followed by soya beans (93.7%), maize (89.4%), sugarcane (80.2%) and wheat (73%).
