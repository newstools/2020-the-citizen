The likelihood of load shedding on Saturday has “significantly” increased following multiple generation unit trips overnight.
“We lost seven generation units at four power stations – Duvha, Tutuka, Kriel and Grootvlei – due to various technical faults. The root causes of these incidents are being investigated and corrective measures to be implemented,” said Eskom in a statement.
Eskom has urged customers to electricity sparingly by setting air-conditioners’ average temperature at 23°C, switching off geysers over peak periods and using the cold water tap rather than using the geyser every time.
“Set your swimming pool pump cycle to run twice a day, three hours at a time. At the end of the day, turn off computers, copiers, printers and fax machines at the switch.
“Eskom also wishes to remind South Africans that there is a possibility of load shedding over the next 18 months, as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health.”
