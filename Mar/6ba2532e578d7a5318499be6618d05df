With the United Kingdom seemingly poised to retain the GTI nomenclature for the forthcoming hot 208, the Peugeot Sport Engineered (PSE) name will be used in other markets with a fresh report from France stating that the newcomer will indeed have electrification.
On course to debut next year, L’Automobile Magazine alleges that the PSE will not have a hybrid or plug-in hybrid drivetrain, but rather an all-electric unit likely to come from the e-208.
Citing fellow French publication, largus.fr, who spoke to Peugeot Sport boss Francois Wales, L’Automobile claims the PSE will not only produce more power than the e-208’s 100 kW, but allegedly also outgun the GTI whose 1.6-litre turbocharged PureTech petrol delivered 155 kW. In addition, the presence of the batteries could see the PSE also eclipse the GTI’s acceleration from 0-100 km/h that stands at 6.5 seconds in spite of their significant weight gain.
Expect more details to be revealed in the coming weeks and months.
