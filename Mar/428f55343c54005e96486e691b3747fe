Barely two days after Limpopo and Eastern Cape experienced horrific accidents that claimed the lives of 43 people, a police officer was killed in another crash in Limpopo.
Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo identified the victim of the accident along the R18 in Zebediela as Sergeant Alfred Molwantwa Lebelo, 37.
Zebediela police said he was off duty at the time.
“Our preliminary investigations have revealed that Lebelo was driving in his private vehicle when his front tyre burst and he lost control of the vehicle.
“The vehicle then crashed into the road barriers and rolled before plunging and landing into a culvert. When officials from the emergency medical service arrived they found Lebelo had already died,” said Mojapelo.
Mojapelo also identified the 17 people who died in accidents on different roads in Limpopo at the weekend.
