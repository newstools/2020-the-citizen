South Africa’s poor new vehicle sales start to the year continued into February with the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) recording a 0.7% drop from last year’s 43 805 units to 43 485 this year.
A largely positive picture however applied to individual segments with new passenger vehicle sales improving by 7.6% from 27 567 to 29 665, while light commercial vehicles went the other way by slipping 17.7% from 14 122 to 11 625.
As was the case last year, sales of medium and heavy duty commercial vehicles were up with the former rising by 3.8% for a total of 686 units, while the latter grew by 3.7% in recording 1 509 unit sales. Exports continued on the downwards trajectory though with a fall of 8.4% from 33 675 to 30 832.
