A private school in Middelburg closed its doors for the day on Wednesday, after a parent confirmed they would be going for testing for the coronavirus, reports Middelburg Observer.
The principle of the school said in a message to parents that the school will be closed on Wednesday, as she did not want to take chances until the parent undergoing testing informs her whether they tested positive or negative.
A screenshot of the message sent to parents at the private school.

The school’s name is being withheld to protect the identity of the parent in question.
