The king arrived at the Great Place at 2am on Friday morning with an axe and started breaking furniture and throwing out clothes belonging to his son Azenathi, the current king regent.
The king was released on parole in December after serving a third of his sentence following his conviction for assault, arson, kidnapping, and defeating the ends of justice.
Those crimes were committed between 1995 and 1996 when he torched the properties of three locals and kidnapped a woman and several children.
