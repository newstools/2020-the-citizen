The load shedding that was expected for Sunday will no longer be necessary thanks to earlier than expected return to service of two generation units at Eskom and “adequate emergency reserves.”
However, the power utility has once again cautioned that “the possibility [of load shedding] remains if there are any shifts in the system.”
