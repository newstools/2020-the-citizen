With a Gazoo Racing (GR) version of the Corolla tipped for introduction in 2023, a report from the United Kingdom has claimed that the C-HR could be heading down the same route in the same year.
Based on the claim from Auto Express, the GR C-HR could follow the Corolla and GR Yaris in becoming the third model to make use of the brand-new 1.6-litre three-cylinder turbocharged engine, albeit detuned from 192kW/360Nm to the 184 kW mulled for the Corolla.
While it will continue to be based on the TNGA platform, the GR C-HR will be extensively revised underneath its skin in the form of a tweaked chassis, upgraded brakes and steering, as well as model bespoke cosmetics and interior trim.
