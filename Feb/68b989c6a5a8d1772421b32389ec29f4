One World won the 2020 Sun Met on Saturday afternoon, with the more favoured Rainbow Bridge and Hawwaam having to settle for second and third, respectively.
He was ridden to victory by MJ Byleveld, trained by Vaughn Marshall and bred by Klawervlei Stud.
Many other thoroughbreds in the form of South Africa’s celebs were also on display though, and you can decide who won first in the fashion stakes.
