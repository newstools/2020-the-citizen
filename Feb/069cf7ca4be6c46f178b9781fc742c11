Soweto residents who were looking forward to a day off from work and school due to Tuesday’s planned #SowetoShutdown were disappointed to learn that the shutdown they were promised did not escalate to the point they thought it would.
Soweto Urban reports that a group of unnamed residents vowed to carry out a two-day shutdown in protest of power cuts, Eskom’s unavailability to engage with the community and the flat rate proposal.
Residents from other areas such as Alexandra, Tembisa, Eldorado Park and the Vaal are expected to participate as well.
“Officers will be deployed and we will work with other law enforcement agencies,” said Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesperson Wayne Minnaar.
“We will deal with it as it unfolds,” he added.
Speaking to the publication, Soweto Shutdown protest leader Dr Trevor Ngwane said all they wanted was to have a meeting with Eskom to come up with a solution for their electricity crisis.
The protestors made their way to the streets this morning but they didn’t disrupt much. This led social media users to question if the shutdown was even happening.

Happy to see them staging the #SowetoShutdown on the side of the road. At the end of the day it will be our sisters and brothers who’ll be in trouble at work for late coming or absenteeism. The school kids will also miss out on important lessons.

One Twitter user even labelled it the “first disappointing shutdown in SA history ever”.

Others even compared it to the annual imaginary Men’s Conference.

I am still in bed undecided whether towakeup or not. Is there a strike or it was just an imaginary strike just like man's conference? #sowetoshutdown pic.twitter.com/dm4UQijwFi
