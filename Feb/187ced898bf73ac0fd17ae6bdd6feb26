Caught partially undisguised by Britain’s Autocar, the performance A3 range will once again consist out of the S3 that will be motivated by the familiar 2.0 TFSI engine the publication claims could produce as much as 240 kW and the RS3 that will keep hold of its five-cylinder 2.5 TFSI engine with power set to be remain as is at 294 kW.
