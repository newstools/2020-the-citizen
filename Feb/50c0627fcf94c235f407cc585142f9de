A Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) Premier Classe passenger train collided with a stationary Transnet goods train between Roodepoort and Horizon Station on Wednesday evening.

The passenger train departed Cape Town on Tuesday.
Main Line Passenger Services teams were at the scene to establish the cause of the accident.


ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring told News24 the deceased male sustained numerous injuries, and when he was found inside a carriage of the passenger train, he had already died.
Meiring also said there was an elderly woman trapped in the same carriage, and that rescue personnel worked for more than two hours to free her, after which she was airlifted to a hospital for further treatment.

Metrorail services along the Randfontein to Johannesburg lines will be affected, and commuters are urged to make alternative arrangements.
Mbalula has welcomed a police probe into the crash, saying he had full confidence that the administrator and authorities would find the cause and “devise strategies to minimise similar occurrences in future”.
