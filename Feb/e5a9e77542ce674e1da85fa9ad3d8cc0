If you’ve been surprised by the ever-changing load shedding schedule this week, you’re not alone – even Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has been left in the dark.
Mboweni took to social media to off-load about load shedding in the early hours on Saturday morning.
It appears the outage caught the minister and his team at work drafting the budget speech, which is scheduled to be presented to Parliament on Wednesday.
“As the Core Budget Speech drafting Team was working, load shedding! We had to adjourn! So frustrating. Ku Rough! But, the sun will rise tomorrow and we shall soldier on,” he tweeted.


However, sympathy for Mboweni was severely lacking as Twitter users expressed their outrage.








Some suggested he use the downtime to contemplate the effect the rolling blackouts have had on small businesses.
