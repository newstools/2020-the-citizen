Ngcongca’s contract with the defending Absa Premiership champions is set to expire at the end of the season and the team is looking to offer the defender with a one-year extension. However, the Bafana Bafana defender revealed he would like the team to extend his stay at the Brazilians by more than a year.
“My agent [Mike Makaab] is busy [negotiating] with Sundowns. To be honest, [the disagreement] is not about money. I can say that it’s the number of years we’re not agreeing on, I want two and at the moment they’ve given me one,” Ngcongca told The Sowetan.
“In Belgium, I played nine seasons for one team (KRC Genk) and when I performed well, my contract was extended every time after six months. Here [at Sundowns] it’s different. I want to secure my future.”
“Look, I am experienced enough. If we don’t come to the agreement I will see what I’ll do. At the moment, I am focused on finishing the season [then] we will take it from there,” added Ngcongca.
Ngcongca hinted that a return to Europe was a possibility if they don’t agree on a new deal with Sundowns.
“I have a great relationship in Europe and I am still in touch with many people there, especially those who are involved in coaching but at this moment, I am fully focused on the job at hand – that’s helping Sundowns win games.”
