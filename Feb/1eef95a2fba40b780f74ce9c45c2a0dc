Police on Friday released images of the man they believe shot and wounded a civil attorney in broad daylight near his home in Gardens, Cape Town.
The man was caught on surveillance footage in the quiet, tree-lined Constantia Road on the morning of February 12, when 53-year-old Jakes van der Merwe was ambushed while in his vehicle.
Suspect sought by CPT police for attempted murder. If you recognise this man, or his silver/charcoal Hyundai H1 minibus in the attached images, contact WO Shaun Bardien of CPT Central #SAPS on 082 469 3176 or 073 220 0653.
“The suspect, who is a white male, fired two shots at his victim from a seated position in his vehicle, wounding him in the neck,” said Colonel Andrè Traut.
At the crime scene, a bullet hole was seen in the window on the driver’s side of the grey Land Cruiser, and another on the metal panel between the driver and passenger windows.

In an unrelated incident in December, Cape Town advocate Vernon Jantjies was shot dead in an apparent hit at a petrol station in Mitchells Plain.
The murder followed those of prominent Cape Town advocate Pete Mihalik and attorney Noorudien Hassan, all in the last few years.
Hassan was shot in his car outside his home in Lansdowne, Cape Town, on November 7, 2016.
Mihalik, who worked closely with Hassan, was shot dead while dropping off his children at Reddam House Atlantic Seaboard School in Green Point, Cape Town, on October 30, 2018.
If you recognise the man or the vehicle in the images, please contact Warrant Officer Shaun Bardien of Cape Town Central police on 082-469-3176 or 073-220-0653.
