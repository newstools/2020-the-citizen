Since the video was posted five hours ago, the list of names has since been narrowed down to Nicki Minaj, Megan The Stallion and Cardi B, who is clearly a fan favourite.
The official announcement will be made tomorrow.
On Monday morning, the brand announced a new ticket price special for their flagship event without revealing who concert-goers would be purchasing the tickets for.
“Castle Lite will release a limited number of Early Bird tickets this week. These tickets will begin selling at the jaw-dropping price of R50 and will increase by an additional R50 every 30 minutes. So, the longer you wait to snatch up your tickets the more expensive they will become,” the brand announced in a statement.
They also teased fans by adding “be the first to get your tickets and you could be the first know who we’re unlocking.”
