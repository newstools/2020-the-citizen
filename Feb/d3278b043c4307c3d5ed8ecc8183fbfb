This after hundreds of thousand of commuters have been left stranded when the power utility suddenly cut Metrorail’s power on Thursday afternoon, with trains unable to run.

“We have engaged the customer [Prasa] over a lengthy period of time trying to get them to settle their account and today we terminated supply,” Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha told News24. “However, at this point, we have received a proof of payment which brings Prasa’s account to current.”
