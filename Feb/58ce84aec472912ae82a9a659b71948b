Mbele said once at the hospital, the suspect was questioned by the police and the suspect revealed that he is part of a group of five, targeting retail stores in Ballito, Verulam and Dubarn.
“The suspect was place under guard police and will appear in court for robbery once he is released. He will also be profiled to check if he is linked to other cases,” Mbele said.
