“This situation has evolved into acts of intimidation therefore we have decided to suspend all academic activities scheduled for Monday, 24 February. This includes assessments scheduled for this evening,” the statement read.
The exact reason for the disruption was not yet known on Monday.
However, Capricorn FM reported on Tuesday morning that a South African Students Congress (Sasco) convener at the university alleged that National Student Financial Aid Scheme funding delays, registration delays and malfunctioning Wi-Fi are among the reasons why protests took place on Monday.
Scenes from the campus chaos were shared on Twitter yesterday.
