Two children, aged nine and three, were injured when a bakkie crashed into their home in B Section, Parkgate, KwaZulu-Natal, on Monday afternoon.
At about 5pm, Reaction Unit South Africa members arrived at the residence and found that a large mob had gathered at the scene.
According to witnesses, the blue Ford Bantam bakkie was driven by a mechanic who was believed to be unlicensed.
He lost control of the bakkie and hit a light pole before crashing into the house.
Two children who were playing inside were moderately injured and were taken to a provincial hospital by ambulance.
The driver fled the scene and the bakkie was extensively damaged.
